Einstein compares the emission or absorption\nof radiation of frequency v corresponding to a transition between two sta-\nionary states with the emission or absorption to be expected on ordinary\nelectrodynamics for a system consisting of a particle executing harmonic\nvibrations of this frequency. In analogy with the fact that on the latter\nheory such a system will without external excitation emit a radiation of\nrequency v, Einstein assumes in the first place that on the quantum theory\nhere will be a certain probability At dt that the system in the stationary\nstate of greater energy, characterised by the letter n’, in the time interval\ndt will start spontaneously to pass to the stationary state of smaller energy,\ncharacterised by the letter n”. Moreover, on ordinary electrodynamics the\nharmonic vibrator will, in addition to the above mentioned independent\nemission, in the presence of a radiation of frequency v in the surrounding\nspace, and dependent on the accidental phase—defference between this radi-\nation and the vibrator, emit or absorb radiation—-energy. In analogy with\nhis, Einstein assumes secondly that in the presence of a radiation in the\nsurrounding space, the system will on the quantum theory, in addition to\nhe above mentioned probability of spontaneous transition from the state n’\no the state n”, possess a certain probability, depending on this radiation,\nof passing in the time dt from the state n’ to the state n”, as well as from\nhe state n” to the state n’. These latter probabilities are assumed to be\nproportional to the intensity of the surrounding radiation and are denoted\nby ov BY, dt and ov BY dt respectively, where g,dv denotes the amount of\nradiation in unit volume of the surrounding space distributed on frequencies\nbetween v and v + dv, while Br, and Br are constants which, like An,\ndepend only on the stationary states under consideration. Einstein does not\nintroduce any detailed assumption as to the values of these constants, no\nmore than to the conditions by which the different stationary states of a\ngiven system are determined or to the ‘a-priory probability’ of these states\non which their relative occurrence in a distribution of statistical equilibrium\ndepends.

In § 2\nwe saw that in the proof of the mechanical invariance of relation (10) for a\nperiodic system of one degree of freedom, it was essential that the compara-\nive variation of the external conditions during the time of one period could\nbe made small. This may be regarded as an immediate consequence of the\nnature of the fixation of the stationary states in the quantum theory. In fact\nhe answer to the question whether a given state of a system is stationary,\nwill not depend only on the motion of the particles at a given moment or\non the field of force in the immediate neighbourhood of their instantaneous\npositions, but cannot be given before the particles have passed through a\ncomplete cycle of states, and so to speak have got to know the entire field of\norce of influence on the motion. If thus, in the case of a periodic system of\none degree of freedom, the field of force is varied by a given amount, and if\nits comparative variation within the time of a single period was not small,\nhe particle would obviously have no means to get to know the nature of the\nvariation of the field and to adjust its stationary motion to it, before the\nnew field was already established. For exactly the same reasons it is nec-\nessary condition for the mechanical invariance of the stationary states of a\nconditionally periodic system, that the alteration of the external conditions\nduring an interval in which the system has passed approximately through all\npossible configurations within the above mentioned s—dimensional extension\nin the coordinate— space can be made as small as we like. This condition\nforms therefore also an essential point in Burgers’ proof of the invariance\nof the conditions (22) for mechanical transformations. Due to this we meet\nwith a characteristic difficulty when during the transformation of the system\nwe pass one of the cases of degeneration mentioned above, where, for every\nset of values for the a’s, the orbit will not cover the s—dimensional extension\neverywhere dense, but will be confined to an extension of less dimensions. It\nis clear that, when by a slow transformation of a conditionally periodic sys-\ntem we approach a degenerate system of this kind, the time—interval which\nthe orbit takes to pass to any possible configuration will tend to be very long\nand will become infinite when the degenerate system is reached.
