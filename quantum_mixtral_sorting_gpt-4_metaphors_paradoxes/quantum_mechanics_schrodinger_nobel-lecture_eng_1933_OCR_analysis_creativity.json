We are, however, used\nto this in such calculations and it does not prevent us from calculating that\nthe nucleus of the atom must produce a kind of diffraction phenomenon in\nthese waves, similarly as a minute dust particle does in light waves. Analo-\ngously, it follows that there is a close relationship between the extent of the\narea of interference with which the nucleus surrounds itself and the wave-\nlength, and that the two are of the same order of magnitude. What this is,\nwe have had to leave open; but the most important step now follows: we\nidentify the area of interference, the diffraction halo, with the atom; we assert that\nthe atom in reality is merely the diffraction phenomenon of an electron wave cap-\ntured us it were by the nucleus of the atom. It is no longer a matter of chance\nthat the size of the atom and the wavelength are of the same order of magni-\ntude: it is a matter of course.

There are two possible ways of determining it, which provide\na mutual check on one another. First, we can so select it that the manifesta-\ntions of life of the atom, above all the spectrum lines emitted, come out\ncorrectly quantitatively; these can after all be measured very accurately.\nSecondly, we can select a in a manner such that the diffraction halo acquires\nthe size required for the atom. These two determinations of a (of which the\nsecond is admittedly far more imprecise because \"size of the atom\" is no\nclearly defined term) are in complete agreement with one another. Thirdly, and\nlastly, we can remark that the constant remaining unknown, physically\nspeaking, does not in fact have the dimension of a length, but of an action,\nie. energy x time. It is then an obvious step to substitute for it the numerical\nvalue of Planck’s universal quantum of action, which is accurately known\nfrom the laws of heat radiation.
