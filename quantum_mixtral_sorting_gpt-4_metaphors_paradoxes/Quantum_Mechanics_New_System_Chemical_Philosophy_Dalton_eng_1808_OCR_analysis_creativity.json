Or, soda contains 75\nper cent. metal and 25 oxygen; potash, 83.3 metal and\n16.7 oxygen. It is particularly remarkable, that accord-\ning to the above-mentioned gentleman’s essay on the De-\ncomposition and Composition of the fixed alkalies, in the\nPhilosophical Transactions (a copy of which essay be has\njust favoured me with) it appears that “ the largest quan-\ntity of oxygen indicated by these experiments was, for\npotash 17, and for soda, 26 parts in 100, and the smallest\n13 and 19.”",

This\nI judge to be very nearly true. Now, if 35\nmuriatic acid require 65 oxygen, 22 will take\n41; but 22 is the weight of an atom of muri-\natic acid, and 41 or 42 is the weight of 6 atoms\nof oxygen; hence the constitution of hyper-\noxymuriatic acid is determined. An atom of\nit consists of 1 atom of muriatic acid + 6 atoms\nof oxygen, or of 1 atom of oxymuriatic acid +\n5 atoms of oxygen ; and its weight is rcpre-\nsented by Gt. We may now see what takes\nplace in the formation of hyperoxymuriates.\nOne atom of oxymuriatic acid deprives 5 sur-\nrounding atoms, each of an atom of oxygen;\nan atom of hyperoxymuriate thus necessarily\nproduces 5 atoms of simple muriate. Sup-\nposing the salts from potash, their weights may\nbe found thus: An atom of potash weighs 42,\none of hyperoxymuriatic acid weighs 64, to-\ngether = 106. Five atoms of muriate of pot-\nash = 320; the sum of both = 426. Now, if\n426 :106:: 100: 25 nearly.

Mr. Davy’s ideas on this subject,\nin his Electrochemical Researches, 1808, were,\nthat the acid gas contains water in a combined\nstate ; or, to use my own phraseology, that an\natom of real muriatic acid combined with one\nof water, formed one of the acid gas; hence,\nin burning potasium in the gas, the potasium\ndecomposed the water, the hydrogen was li-\nberated, and the oxygen joined to the potasium\nto form potash, with which the real or dry\nacid immediately united. This conclusion was\nplausible ; but it was truly astonishing to see\nthe French chemists draw the same conclusion",
