In 1925 Einstein publishes a second part of this paper (Sitzungsberichte der Preussischen\nAkademie der Wissenschaften, Berlin, Physikalisch-mathematische Klasse, 1925, p. 3-14; we refer\nto this as the second paper) in which he investigates, among other, the existence of what is now known\nas the Bose-Einstein condensates.
