However, there are some particular\naspects which I should like to discuss on whatis, for me, such a festive occa-\nsion. The first point is this: the work at the Géttingen school, which I\ndirected at that time (1926-1927), contributed to the solution of an intellec-\ntual crisis into which our science had fallen as a result of Planck’s discovery\nof the quantum of action in 1900.

All the other branches of classical\nphysics have been built up according to this model. Mechanical determinism\ngradually became a kind of article of faith: the world as a machine, an\nautomaton. As far as I can see, this idea has no forerunners in ancient and\nmedieval philosophy. The idea is a product of the immense success of\nNewtonian mechanics, particularly in astronomy. In the 19th century it be-\ncame a basic philosophical principle for the whole of exact science. I asked\nmyself whether this was really justified. Can absolute predictions really be\nmade for all time on the basis of the classical equations of motion? It can\neasily be seen, by simple examples, that this is only the case when the\npossibility of absolutely exact measurement (of position, velocity, or other\nquantities) is assumed. Let us think of a particle moving without friction on\na straight line between two end-points (walls), at which it experiences com-\npletely elastic recoil. It moves with constant speed equal to its initial speed\nv backwards and forwards, and it can be stated exactly where it will be at\na given time provided that v,is accurately known. But if a small inaccuracy\nAv, is allowed, then the inaccuracy of prediction of the position at time t is\nt Av, which increases with t. If one waits long enough until time f= Avo\nwhere | is the distance between the elastic walls, the inaccuracy 4x will have\nbecome equal to the whole space /. Thus it is impossible to forecast anything\nabout the position at a time which is later than t,. Thus determinism lapses\ncompletely into indeterminism as soon as the slightest inaccuracy in the data\non velocity is permitted. Is there any sense - and I mean any physical sense,\nnot metaphysical sense - in which one can speak of absolute data? Is one\njustified in saying that the coordinate x = mcm where nm = 3.1415. . is the\nfamiliar transcendental number that determines the ratio of the circumfer-\nence of a circle to its diameter? As a mathematical tool the concept of a real\nnumber represented by a nonterminating decimal fraction is exceptionally\nimportant and fruitful. As the measure of a physical quantity it is nonsense. If\nmis taken to the 20th or the 25th place of decimals, two numbers are ob-\ntained which are indistinguishable from each other and the true value of 7\nby any measurement.
