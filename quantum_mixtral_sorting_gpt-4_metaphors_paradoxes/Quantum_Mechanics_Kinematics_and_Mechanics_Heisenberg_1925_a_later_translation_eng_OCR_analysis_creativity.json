For example, let\none illuminate the electron and observe it under a microscope. Then the highest\nattainable accuracy in the measurement of position is governed by the wavelength\nof the light. However, in principle one can build, say, a y-ray microscope and with\nit carry out the determination of position with as much accuracy as one wants. In\nthis measurement there is an important feature, the Compton effect. Every obser-\nvation of scattered light coming from the electron presupposes a photoelectric\neffect (in the eye, on the photographic plate, in the photocell) and can therefore\nalso be so interpreted that a light quantum hits the electron, is reflected or scattered,\nand then, once again bent by the lens of the microscope, produces the photoeffect.\nAt the instant when position is determined—therefore, at the moment when the\nphoton is scattered by the electron—the electron undergoes a discontinuous\nchange in momentum. This change is the greater the smaller the wavelength of\nthe light employed—that is, the more exact the determination of the position. At\nthe instant at which the position of the electron is known, its momentum therefore\ncan be known up to magnitudes which correspond to that discontinuous change.\nThus, the more precisely the position is determined, the less precisely the momen-\ntum is known, and conversely. In this circumstance we see a direct physical\ninterpretation of the equation pq — qp = —ih. Let q, be the precision with which\nthe value g is known (q; is, say, the mean error of q), therefore here the wavelength\nof the light. Let p, be the precision with which the value p is determinable; that is,\nhere, the discontinuous change of p in the Compton effect.

One can always pick\nthe axis of the coordinate system in which one expresses these relations along the\nprincipal axes of one of these tensors. Finally, one also can always characterize the\nmathematical relation between two tensors A and B through the transformation\nequations which take a coordinate system oriented along the principal axes of A\nover into another oriented along the principal axes of B. This latter formulation\ncorresponds to the Schrédinger theory. In contrast, one will view Dirac’s qg-number\nformulation as the formulation of quantum mechanics that is really “invariant”\nand independent of all coordinate systems. When we want to derive physical\nresults from that mathematical framework, then we have to associate numbers\nwith the quantum-theoretical magnitudes—that is, with the matrices (or “tensors”\nin multidimensional space). This task is to be understood in these terms: In that\nmultidimensional space a definite direction is arbitrarily prescribed (by the nature\nof the experimental setup); and it is asked what is the “value” of the matrix (for\nexample, in that picture, what is the value of the moment of inertia) in this given\ndirection. This question only has a well-defined meaning when the given direction\ncoincides with the direction of one of the principal axes of that matrix. In this case\nthere is an exact answer for the question. But also when the prescribed direction\ndiffers only little from one of the principal axes of the matrix one can still speak of\nthe “value” of the matrix in the prescribed direction up to a definite uncertainty\ndetermined by the angle between the two directions. One can therefore say that\nassociated with every quantum-theoretical quantity or matrix is a number which\ngives its “value” within a certain definite statistical error. The statistical error\ndepends on the coordinate system. For every quantum-theoretical quantity there\nexists a coordinate system in which the statistical error for this quantity is zero.\nTherefore a definite experiment can never give exact information on all quantum-\ntheoretical quantities. Rather, it divides physical quantities into “known” and\n“unknown” (or more and less accurately known quantities) in a way characteristic\nof the experiment in question. The results of two experiments can be derived\nexactly one from the other only then when the two experiments divide the physical\nquantities in the same way into “known” and “unknown” (that is, when the tensors\nin that multidimensional space frequently invoked—for ease of visualization—are\n“looked at” in both experiments from the same direction).

A rotator, which we will visualize as a gear-wheel, is provided with an\nattachment which after f revolutions of the wheel exactly reverses the direction of\nits rotation. For example, let the gear-wheel mesh with a toothed sliding member\nwhich moves on a straight line between two stops. The slider hits a stop after a\ndefinite number of rotations and in that way reverses the rotation of the gear-\nwheel. The true period T of the system is long in comparison with the rotation\nperiod t of the wheel. The discrete energy levels are densely packed—and the\ndenser the packing, the greater the value of T. From the standpoint of consistent\nquantum theory all stationary states have the same statistical weight. Therefore,\nfor sufficiently great T, practically all energy values occur with equal frequency, in\nopposition to what would be expected for the rotator. We may sharpen this\nparadox a little before we treat it from our standpoint. Thus, in order to determine\nwhether the system takes on the discrete energy values belonging to the pure\nrotator exclusively or particularly often, or whether it assumes with equal prob-\nability all possible values (that is, values which correspond to the small energy\ninterval h/T), a time t, suffices which is small relative to T (but > 1). In other\nwords, although the long period plays no part at all in such measurements, it\nappears to express itself in the fact that all possible energy values can occur. We\nare of the view that, in reality also, such experiments for the determination of the\ntotal energy of the system would give all possible energy values with equal prob-\nability. The factor responsible for this outcome is not the big period T, but the\nsliding member. Even if the system sometimes happens to have an energy identical\nwith the quantized energy value of the simple rotator, it can be modified easily—by\nexternal forces acting on the stop—to states which do not correspond to the\nquantization of the simple rotator.* The coupled system, rotator-plus-slider,\nindeed shows a periodicity entirely different from that of the rotator. The solution\nof the paradox lies rather in a different circumstance. When we want to measure\nthe energy of the rotator alone, we must first break the coupling between the\nrotator and the slider. In classical theory, when the mass of the slider is sufficiently\nsmall, the coupling can be broken without a change in energy; and there, conse-\nquently, the energy of the entire system can be equated to that of the rotator (for\nsmall slider mass). In quantum mechanics the energy of interaction between slider\nand rotator is at least of the same order of magnitude as the level spacing of the\nrotator (even for small slider mass there is a high zero point energy associated\nwith the elastic interaction between rotator and slider). On decoupling, the slider\nand the rotator individually take their characteristic quantum energies. Conse-\nquently, insofar as we are able to measure the energy values of the rotator alone\nwe always find the quantum energy values with experimental accuracy. Even for",
