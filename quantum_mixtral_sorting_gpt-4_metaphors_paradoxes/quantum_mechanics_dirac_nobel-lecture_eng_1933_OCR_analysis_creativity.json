We now make the\nassumptions that in the world as we know it, nearly all the states of negative\nenergy for the electrons are occupied, with just one electron in each state,\nand that a uniform filling of all the negative-energy states is completely un-\nobservable to us. Further, any unoccupied negative-energy state, being a departure\nfrom uniformity, is observable and is just a positron.\nAn unoccupied negative-energy state, or hole, as we may call it for brevity,\nwill have a positive energy, since it is a place where there is a shortage of\nnegative energy. A hole is, in fact, just like an ordinary particle, and its\nidentification with the positron seems the most reasonable way of getting\nover the difficulty of the appearance of negative energies in our equations.\nOn this view the positron is just a mirror-image of the electron, having\nexactly the same mass and opposite charge. This has already been roughly\nconfirmed by experiment. The positron should also have similar spin prop-\nerties to the electron, but this has not yet been confirmed by experiment.\nFrom our theoretical picture, we should expect an ordinary electron, with\npositive energy, to be able to drop into a hole and fill up this hole, the energy\nbeing liberated in the form of electromagnetic radiation. This would mean\na process in which an electron and a positron annihilate one another. The\nconverse process, namely the creation of an electron and a positron from\nelectromagnetic radiation, should also be able to take place. Such processes\nappear to have been found experimentally, and are at present being more\nclosely investigated by experimenters.\nThe theory of electrons and positrons which I have just outlined is a self-\nconsistent theory which fits the experimental facts so far as is yet known.\nOne would like to have an equally satisfactory theory for protons. One\nmight perhaps think that the same theory could be applied to protons. This\nwould require the possibility of existence of negatively charged protons\norming a mirror-image of the usual positively charged ones. There is, how-\never, some recent experimental evidence obtained by Stern about the spin\nmagnetic moment of the proton, which conflicts with this theory for the\nproton. As the proton is so much heavier than the electron, it is quite likely\nhat it requires some more complicated theory, though one cannot at the\npresent time say what this theory is.",
