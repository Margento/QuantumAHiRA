In\nfact, by further examining the possibilities for the application of a\nbalance arrangement, Einstein had perceived alternative\nprocedures which, even if they did not allow the use he originally\nintended, might seem to enhance the paradoxes beyond the\npossibilities of logical solution. Thus, Einstein had pointed out that,\nafter a preliminary weighing of the box with the clock and the\nsubsequent escape of the photon, one was still left with the choice\nof either repeating the weighing or opening the box and comparing\nthe reading of the clock with the standard time scale.\nConsequently, we are at this stage still free to choose whether we\nwant to draw conclusions either about the energy of the photon or\nabout the moment when it left the box. Without in any way\ninterfering with the photon between its escape and its later\ninteraction with other suitable measuring instruments, we are, thus,\nable to make accurate predictions pertaining either to the moment\nof its arrival or to the amount of energy liberated by its absorption.\nSince, however, according to the quantum-mechanical formalism,\nthe specification of the state of an isolated particle cannot involve\nboth a well-defined connection with the time scale and an accurate\nfixation of the energy, it might thus appear as if this formalism did\nnot offer the means of an adequate description.",

In fact, although any pair gq and p, of conjugate space\nand momentum variables obeys the rule of non-commutative\nmultiplication expressed by (2), and can thus only be fixed with\nreciprocal latitudes given by (3), the difference qi- qz between two\nspace-co-ordinates referring to the constituents of the system will\ncommute with the sum pi + p2 of the corresponding momentum\ncomponents, as follows directly from the commutability of ql with p2\nand q2 with pl. Both ql--g2 and pl + p2 can, therefore, be accurately\nfixed in a state of the complex system and, consequently, we can\npredict the values of either q1 or pl if either g2 or p2, respectively,\nare determined by direct measurements. If, for the two parts of the\nsystem, we take a particle and a diaphragm, like that sketched in\nFig. 5, we see that the possibilities of specifying the state of the\nparticle by measurements on the diaphragm just correspond to the\nsituation described on p. 220 and further discussed on p. 230,\nwhere it was mentioned that, after the particle has passed through\nthe diaphragm, we have in principle the choice of measuring either\nthe position of the diaphragm or its momentum and, in each case,\nto make predictions as to subsequent observations pertaining to\nthe particle.
