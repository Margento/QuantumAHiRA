“Quantum AHiRA” forms part of a broader project that maps the rhetoric of foundational quantum mechanics onto large literary and cultural periodical corpora for analytical and creative purposes.

Metaphors, paradoxes, and argumentation flows from early quantum physics texts were computationally paired with analogous tropes and reasoning patterns in journals from AHiRA and CMoLA (the Argentine Historical Journal Archives and Cultural Magazines of Latin America, 1896–1959; https://recerca.uoc.edu/documentos/67bc32b7478fbf5d29390dc6?lang=en).

Using LLMs, metaphors were first identified in the physics corpus (via GPT-4) and then classified (via Mixtral) as common-speech or field-specific. Automated searches then located passages in the Latin American journals where the semantic contrasts between terms mirrored those in the physics corpus—particularly where both were similarly incongruent within their contexts ('quantum_metaphor_and_paradox_anchors_with_concepts_and_cmola_ahira_matches_2.json').

For this poem, I selected the closest matches: passages from the Spanish articles cited in the notes, and two metaphors from Arnold Sommerfeld’s Atombau und Spektrallinien (1929), a revised and expanded version of his 1919 classic.
