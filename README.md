“Quantum AHiRA” forms part of a broader project that maps the rhetoric of foundational quantum mechanics onto large literary and cultural periodical corpora for analytical and creative purposes.

Metaphors, paradoxes, and argumentation flows from early quantum physics texts were computationally paired with analogous tropes and reasoning patterns in journals from AHiRA and CMoLA (the Argentine Historical Journal Archives and Cultural Magazines of Latin America, 1896–1959; https://recerca.uoc.edu/documentos/67bc32b7478fbf5d29390dc6?lang=en).
