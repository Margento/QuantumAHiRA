“Quantum AHiRA” forms part of a broader project that maps the rhetoric of foundational quantum mechanics ('quantum_foundations_txt') onto large literary and cultural periodical corpora for analytical and creative purposes.

Metaphors, paradoxes, and argumentation flows from early quantum physics texts were computationally paired with analogous tropes and reasoning patterns in journals from AHiRA and CMoLA (the Argentine Historical Journal Archives and Cultural Magazines of Latin America, 1896–1959; https://recerca.uoc.edu/documentos/67bc32b7478fbf5d29390dc6?lang=en, Tanasescu & Roig-Sanz 2025).

Using LLMs, metaphors were first identified in the physics corpus (via GPT-4) and then classified (via Mixtral) as common-speech or field-specific. Automated searches then located passages in the Latin American journals where the semantic contrasts between terms mirrored those in the physics corpus—particularly where both were similarly incongruent within their contexts.

For this poem, I selected the closest matches: the passages from the Spanish articles ('quantum_cmola_ahira_metaphors_slice_0054.jsonl') corresponding to no more than a couple of metaphors from Arnold Sommerfeld’s Atombau und Spektrallinien (1929), a revised and expanded version of his 1919 classic.

In what the LLM tagged in this case as common-speech-like metaphors, Sommerfeld linked relativistic particle orbits (“relativistischen Bahnen”) with co-moving coordinate systems (“mitbewegten Koordinatensystem”). This figurative bridge lies at the core of his theoretical innovation—-using relativity and quantum numbers to define orbits as processing ellipses requiring co-moving frames, a dynamic that also invoked a third term, “Modifikation.”

The journal sentences identified as most akin to these scientific metaphors were imported into two compositional modes:
1.	“Orbiting_recursions.” These stanzas foreground the contrastive nature of the metaphors through a concrete-poetic method of word decomposition and recombination across Spanish and (multilingual or Creolized) English. Their visual structure evokes Sommerfeld’s processing ellipses, enabling recursive reading and reconfiguration.
2.	“Pulse_flash_spectral.” These stanzas retain full sentences from the Spanish database, paired with their English (and sporadically Aromanian or Zoque) 'translations'—-homophonic, deflatus-driven, parodically cynical, and hegemonically self-exposing. The term reflects the interplay between sonic (gappy) homogeneity and semantic dissonance (or, at times, aberration).

The intermedia process began with sound and evolved toward moving image. The discrete qualities of each stanza—-prosodic, affective, and temporal—-were converted into analog sound frequencies. Textual features such as meter, rhythmic variation/energy, and fricative/plosive density were mapped to base frequency, amplitude, noise, and transient clicks. Affective parameters (e.g., arousal or smoothness) became spectral brightness and filter cutoff; lastly, temporal structures (linear, cyclical, recursive) were rendered as stereo motion, pacing oscillations, or feedback loops. These values were interpolated via SigTo and low-frequency oscillators (LFOs), translating linguistic/stylistic features into evolving sonic modulations.
