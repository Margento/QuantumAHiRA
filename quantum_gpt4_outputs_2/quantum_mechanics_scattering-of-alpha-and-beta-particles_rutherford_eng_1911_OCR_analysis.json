This scattering is far more marked\nfor the @ than for the a particle on account of the much\nsmaller momentum and energy of the former particle.\nThere seems to be no doubt that such swiftly moving par-\nticles pass through the atoms in their path, and that the\ndeflexions observed are due to the strong electric field\ntraversed within the atomic system. It has generally been\nsupposed that the scattering of a pencil of a or @ rays in\npassing through a thin plate of matter is the result of a\nmultitude of small scatterings by the atoms of matter\ntraversed. The observations, however, of Geiger and\nMarsden f on the scattering of a rays indicate that some of\nthe @ particles must suffer a deflexion of more than a right\nangle at a single encounter. They found, for example, that\nasmall fraction of the incident @ particles, about 1 in 20,000,\nwere turned through an average angle of 90° in passing\nthrough a layer of gold-foil about 00004 em. thick, which\nwas equivalent in stopping-power of the a particle to 1°6 milli-\nmetres of air.

Suppose, for example,\nthe central charge to be composed of N unit charges dis-\ntributed over such a volume that the large single deflexions\nare mainly due to the constituent charges and not to the\nexternal field produced by the distribution. It has been\nshown (§ 3) that the fraction of the « particles scattered\nthrough a large angle is proportional to (NeE)?, where Ne is\nthe central charge concentrated at a point and E the charge\non the deflected particle. If, however, this charge is dis-\ntributed in single units, the fraction of the a particles\nscattered through a given angle is proportional to Ne? instead\nof N’e, In this calculation, the influence of mass of the\nconstituent particle hus been neglected, and account has only\nbeen taken of its electric field. Since it has been shown that\nthe value of the central point charge for gold must be about\n100, the value of the distributed charge required to produce\nthe same proportion of single deflexions through a large\nangle should be at least 10,000.
