A masterful advance\nwas made by Heisenberg in 1925, who showed how equations of classical\nphysies could be taken over in a formal way and made to apply to quantities\nof importance in quantum theory, thereby establishing the Correspondence\nPrinciple on a quantitative basis and laying the foundations of the new\nQuantum Mechanies. Heisenberg’s scheme was found to fit wonderfully well\nwith the Hamiltonian theory of elassical mechanies and enabled one to apply\nto quantum theory all the information that classical theory supplies, in so far\nas this information is consistent with the Hamiltonian form, Thus one was\nable to build up a satisfactory quantum mechanies for dealing with any\ndynamical system composed of interacting particles, provided the interaction\ncould be expressed by means of an energy term to be added to the Hamiltonian\nfunction.",
