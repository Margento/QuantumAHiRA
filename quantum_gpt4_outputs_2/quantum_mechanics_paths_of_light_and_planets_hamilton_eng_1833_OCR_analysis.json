It could\nnot fail to be observed that when a man looked at any object, he had it in his power to\ninterrupt his vision of that object, and hide it at pleasure from his view, by interposing his\nhand between his eyes and it; and that then, by withdrawing his hand, he could see the\nobject as before: and thus the notion of straight lines or rays of communication, between\na visible object and a seeing eye, must very easily and early have arisen. This notion of\nstraight lines of vision, was of of course confirmed by the obvious remark that objects can\nusually be seen on looking through a straight but not through a bent tube; and the most\nfamiliar facts of perspective supplied, we may suppose, new confirmations and new uses of\nthe principle. A globe, for example, from whatever point it may be viewed, appears to have a\ncircular outline; while a plate, or a round table, seems oval when viewed obliquely: and these\nfacts may have been explained, and reduced to mathematical reasoning, by shewing that the\nstraight rays or lines of vision, which touch any one given globe and pass through any one\ngiven point, are arranged in a hollow cone of a perfectly circular shape; but that the straight\nrays, which connect an eye with the round edge of a plate or table, compose, when they\nare oblique, an elliptical or oval cone. The same principle, of seeing in straight lines, must\nhave been continually employed from the earliest times in the explanation of other familiar\nappearances, and in interpreting the testimony of sight respecting the places of visible bodies.\nIt was, for example, an essential element in ancient as in modern astronomy.",

But when astronomers had actually observed appearances, which seemed\nand still seem explicable only by this opinion of the gradual propagation of light from objects\no the eye, the opinion itself became required, and was adopted, in the legitimate process of\ninduction.\nBy such steps, then, it has become an established theorem, fundamental in optical sci-\nence, that the communication, whether between an illuminating body and a body illuminated,\nor between an object seen and a beholding eye, is effected by the gradual but very rapid pas-\nsage of some thing, or influence, or state, called light, from the luminous or visible body,\nalong mathematical or physical lines, usually called rays, and found to be, under the most\ncommon circumstances, exactly or nearly straight.\nAgain, it was very early perceived that in appearances connected with mirrors, flat or\ncurved, the luminous or visual communication is effected in bent lines. When we look into a\nflat mirror, and seem to see an object, such as a candle, behind it, we should err if we were to\nextend to this new case the rules of our more familiar experience. We should not now come to\nouch the candle by continuing the straight line from the eye to a hand or other obstacle, so\nplaced between the eye and the mirror as to hide the candle; this line continued would meet\nhe mirror in a certain place from which it would be necessary to draw a new and different\nstraight line, if we wished to reach the real or tangible candle: and the whole bent line, made\nup of these two straight parts, is found to be now the line of visual communication, and is\no be regarded now as the linear path of the light. An opaque obstacle, placed any where on\neither part of this bent line, is found to hide the reflected candle from the eye; but an obstacle,\nplaced any where else, produces no such interruption. And the law was very early discovered,\nhat for every such bent line of luminous or visual communication, the angle between any\nwo successive straight parts is bisected by the normal, or perpendicular, to the mirror at the\npoint of bending.\nAnother early and important observation, was that of the broken or refracted lines of\ncommunication, between an object in water and an eye in air, and generally between a point\nin one ordinary medium and a point in another. A valuable series of experiments on such\nrefraction was made and recorded by Ptolemy; but it was not till long afterwards that the\nlaw was discovered by Snellius. He found that if two lengths, in a certain ratio or proportion\ndetermined by the natures of the two media, be measured, from the point of breaking, or\nof bending, on the refracted ray and on the incident ray prolonged, these lengths have one\ncommon projection on the refracting surface, or on its tangent plane. This law of ordinary\nrefraction has since been improved by Newton’s discovery of the different refrangibility of\nthe differently coloured rays; and has been applied to explain and to calculate the apparent\nelevation of the stars, produced by the atmosphere of the earth.\nThe phenomena presented by the passage of light through crystals were not observed\nuntil more lately. Bartolinus seems to have been the first to notice the double refraction of\nIceland spar; and Huygens first discovered the laws of this refraction. The more complicated",

To reconcile this metaphysical\nopinion with the law of refraction, discovered experimentally by Snellius, Fermat was led to\nsuppose that the two lengths, or indices, which Snellius had measured on the incident ray\nprolonged and on the refracted ray, and had observed to have one common projection on a\nrefracting plane, are inversely proportional to the two successive velocities of the light before\nand after refraction, and therefore that the velocity of light is diminished on entering those\ndenser media in which it is observed to approach the perpendicular: for Fermat believed that\nhe time of propagation of light along a line bent by refraction was represented by the sum\nof the two products, of the incident portion multiplied by the index of the first medium, and\nof the refracted portion multiplied by the index of the second medium; because he found, by\nhis mathematical method, that this sum was less, in the case of a plane refractor, than if\night went by any other than its actual path from one given point to another; and because he\nperceived that the supposition of a velocity inversely as the index, reconciled his mathematical\ndiscovery of the minimum of the foregoing sum with his cosmological principle of least time.\nDes Cartes attacked Fermat’s opinions respecting light, but Leibnitz zealously defended them;\nand Huygens was led, by reasonings of a very different kind, to adopt Fermat’s conclusions of\na velocity inversely as the index, and of a minimum time of propagation of light, in passing\nfrom one given point to another through an ordinary refracting plane. Newton, however,\nby his theory of emission and attraction, was led to conclude that the velocity of light was\ndirectly, not inversely, as the index, and that it was increased instead of being diminished\non entering a denser medium; a result incompatible with the theorem of shortest time in\nrefraction. The theorem of shortest time was accordingly abandoned by many, and among\nhe rest by Maupertuis, who, however, proposed in its stead, as a new cosmological principle,\nhat celebrated law of least action which has since acquired so high a rank in mathematical\nphysics, by the improvements of Euler and Lagrange. Maupertuis gave the name of action to\nhe product of space and velocity, or rather to the sum of all such products for the various\nelements of any motion; conceiving that the more space has been traversed and the less time\nit has been traversed in, the more action may be considered to have been expended: and by\ncombining this idea of action with Newton’s estimate of the velocity of light, as increased by a\ndenser medium, and as proportional to the refracting index, and with Fermat’s mathematical\nheorem of the minimum sum of the products of paths and indices in ordinary refraction at a\nplane, he concluded that the course chosen by light corresponded always to the least possible\naction, though not always to the least possible time. He proposed this view as reconciling\nphysical and metaphysical principles, which the results of Newton had seemed to put in\nopposition to each other; and he soon proceeded to extend his law of least action to the\nphenomena of the shock of bodies. Euler, attached to Maupertuis, and pleased with these\nnovel results, employed his own great mathematical powers to prove that the law of least\naction extends to all the curves described by points under the influence of central forces; or,\no speak more precisely, that if any such curve be compared with any other curve between\nhe same extremities, which differs from it indefinitely little in shape and in position, and\nmay be imagined to be described by a neighbouring point with the same law of velocity, and\nif we give the name of action to the integral of the product of the velocity and an element of a\ncurve, the difference of the two neighbouring values of this action will be indefinitely less than\nhe greatest linear distance (itself indefinitely small) between the two near curves; a theorem\nwhich I think may be advantageously expressed by saying that the action is stationary.",
