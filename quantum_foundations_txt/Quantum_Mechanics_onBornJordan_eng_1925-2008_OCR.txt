The 1925 paper “On quantum mechanics” by M. Born and P. Jordan, and the sequel “On quantum
mechanics II” by M. Born, W. Heisenberg, and P. Jordan, developed Heisenberg’s pioneering theory
into the first complete formulation of quantum mechanics. The Born and Jordan paper is the subject
of the present article. This paper introduced matrices to physicists. We discuss the original postulates
of quantum mechanics, present the two-part discovery of the law of commutation, and clarify the
origin of Heisenberg’s equation. We show how the 1925 proof of energy conservation and Bohr’s
frequency condition served as the gold standard with which to measure the validity of the new
quantum mechanics. © 2009 American Association of Physics Teachers.

I. INTRODUCTION

The name “quantum mechanics” was coined by Max
Born.' For Born and others, quantum mechanics denoted a
canonical theory of atomic and electronic motion of the same
level of generality and consistency as classical mechanics.
The transition from classical mechanics to a true quantum
mechanics remained an elusive goal prior to 1925.

Heisenberg made the breakthrough in his historic 1925
paper, “Quantum- theoretical reinterpretation of kinematic
and mechanical relations.” ? Heisenberg’ s bold idea was to
retain the classical equations of Newton but to replace the
classical position coordinate with a “quantum-theoretical
quantity.” The new position quantity contains information
about the measurable line spectrum of an atom rather than
the unobservable orbit of the electron. Born realized that
Heisenberg’s kinematical rule for multiplying position quan-
tities was equivalent to the mathematical rule for multiplying
matrices. The next step was to formalize Heisenberg’s theory
using the language of matrices.

The first comprehensive exposition on quantum mechanics
in matrix form was written by Born and Jordan,’ and the
sequel was written by Born, Heisenberg, and Jordan.° Dirac
independently discovered the general equations of quantum
mechanics without using matrix theory.° These papers devel-
oped a Hamiltonian mechanics of the atom in a completely
new quantum (noncommutative) format. These papers ush-
ered in a new era in theoretical physics where Hermitian
matrices, commutators, and eigenvalue problems became the
mathematical trademark of the atomic world. We discuss the
first paper “On quantum mechanics. aa

This formulation of quantum mechanics, now referred to
as matrix mechanics,’ marked one of the most intense peri-
ods of discovery in physics. The ideas and formalism behind
the original matrix mechanics are absent in most textbooks.
Recent articles discuss the correspondence between classical
harmonics and quantum jumps, * the calculational details of
Heisenberg’s paper,” and the role of Born in the creation of
quantum theory. References 11-19 represent a sampling of
the many sources on the development of quantum mechan-
ics.

Given Born and Jordan’s pivotal role in the discovery of
quantum mechanics, it is natural to wonder why there are no
equations named after them,” and why they did not share the
Nobel Prize with others.”! In 1933 Heisenberg wrote Born
saying “The fact that I am to receive the Nobel Prize alone,
128

for work done in Gottingen in collaboration—you, Jordan,
and I, this fact depresses me and I hardly know what to write
to you. I am, of course, glad that our common efforts are
now appreciated, and I enjoy the recollection of the beautiful
time of collaboration. I also believe that all good physicists
know how great was your and Jordan’s contribution to the
structure of quantum mechanics—and this remains un-
changed by a wrong decision from outside. Yet I myself can
do nothing but thank you again for all the fine collaboration
and feel a little ashamed.””

Engraved on Max Born’s tombstone is a one-line epitaph:
Pq-qp=h/27i. Born composed this elegant equation in
early July 1925 and called it “die verschirfte
Quantenbedingung”™ —the sharpened quantum condition.
This equation is now known as the law of commutation and
is the hallmark of quantum algebra.

In the contemporary approach to teaching quantum me-
chanics, matrix mechanics is usually introduced after a thor-
ough discussion of wave mechanics. The Heisenberg picture
is viewed as a unitary transformation of the Schrodinger
picture. * How was matrix mechanics formulated in 1925
when the Schrédinger picture was nowhere in sight? The
Born and Jordan paper’ represents matrix mechanics in its
purest form.

Il. BACKGROUND TO “ON QUANTUM
MECHANICS”

Heisenberg’ S program, as indicated by the title of his
paper,” consisted of constructing quantum-theoretical rela-
tions by reinterpreting the classical relations. To appreciate
what Born and Jordan did with Heisenberg’s reinterpreta-
tions, we discuss in, the Appendix four key relations from
Heisenberg’s paper.” Heisenberg wrote the classical and
quantum versions of each relation in parallel—as formula
couplets. Heisenberg has been likened to an “expert decoder
who reads a cryptogram.” °° The correspondence principle*
acted as a “code book” for translating a classical relation into
its quantum counterpart. Unlike his predecessors who used
the correspondence principle to produce specific relations,
Heisenberg produced an entirely new theory—complete with
a new representation of position and a new rule of multipli-
cation, together with an equation of motion and a quantum
condition whose solution determined the atomic observables
(energies, frequencies, and transition amplitudes).

Matrices are not explicitly mentioned in Heisenberg’s pa-
per. He did not arrange his quantum-theoretical quantities
into a table or array. In looking back on his discovery,
Heisenberg wrote, “At that time I must confess I did not
know what a matrix was and did not know the rules of ma-
trix multiplication.”!® In the last sentence of his paper he
wrote “whether this method after all represents far too rough
an approach to the physical program of constructing a theo-
retical quantum mechanics, an obviously very involved prob-
lem at the moment, can be decided only by a more intensive
mathematical investigation of the method which has been
very superficially employed here.”

Born took up Heisenberg’s challenge to pursue “a more
intensive mathematical investigation.” At the time Heisen-
berg wrote his paper, he was Born’s assistant at the Univer-
sity of Gottingen. Born recalls the moment of inspiration
when he realized that position and momentum were
matrices:**

After having sent Heisenberg’s paper to the
Zeitschrift fiir Physik for publication, I began to
ponder about his symbolic multiplication, and was
soon so involved in it...For I felt there was some-
thing fundamental behind it...And one morning,
about 10 July 1925, I suddenly saw the light:
Heisenberg’s symbolic multiplication was nothing
but the matrix calculus, well known to me since
my student days from the lectures of Rosanes in
Breslau.

I found this by just simplifying the notation a little:
instead of g(n,n+7), where n is the quantum num-
ber of one state and 7 the integer indicating the
transition, I wrote g(n,m), and rewriting Heisen-
berg’s form of Bohr’s quantum condition, I recog-
nized at once its formal significance. It meant that
the two matrix products pq and qp are not identi-
cal. I was familiar with the fact that matrix multi-
plication is not commutative; therefore I was not
too much puzzled by this result. Closer inspection
showed that Heisenberg’s formula gave only the
value of the diagonal elements (m=n) of the ma-
trix pq—qp; it said they were all equal and had the
value h/27i where h is Planck’s constant and i
=\-1. But what were the other elements (m#n)?

Here my own constructive work began. Repeating
Heisenberg’s calculation in matrix notation, I soon
convinced myself that the only reasonable value of
the nondiagonal elements should be zero, and I
wrote the strange equation

h
pq-qp=-—l, (1)

2a

where 1 is the unit matrix. But this was only a
guess, and all my attempts to prove it failed.

On 19 July 1925, Born invited his former assistant Wolf-

129 Am. J. Phys., Vol. 77, No. 2, February 2009

gang Pauli to collaborate on the matrix program. Pauli de-
clined the invitation.” The next day, Born asked his student
Pascual Jordan to assist him. Jordan accepted the invitation
and in a few days proved Born’s conjecture that all nondi-
agonal elements of pq—qp must vanish. The rest of the new
quantum mechanics rapidly solidified. The Born and Jordan
paper was received by the Zeitschrift fiir Physik on 27 Sep-
tember 1925, two months after Heisenberg’s paper was re-
ceived by the same journal. All the essentials of matrix me-
chanics as we know the subject today fill the pages of this
paper.

In the abstract Born and Jordan wrote “The recently pub-
lished theoretical approach of Heisenberg is here developed
into a systematic theory of quantum mechanics (in the first
place for systems having one degree of freedom) with the aid
of mathematical matrix methods.”*° In the introduction they
go on to write “The physical reasoning which led Heisenberg
to this development has been so clearly described by him
that any supplementary remarks appear superfluous. But, as
he himself indicates, in its formal, mathematical aspects his
approach is but in its initial stages. His hypotheses have been
applied only to simple examples without being fully carried
through to a generalized theory. Having been in an advanta-
geous position to familiarize ourselves with his ideas
throughout their formative stages, we now strive (since his
investigations have been concluded) to clarify the math-
ematically formal content of his approach and present some
of our results here. These indicate that it is in fact possible,
starting with the basic premises given by Heisenberg, to
build up a closed mathematical theory of quantum mechanics
which displays strikingly close analogies with classical me-
chanics, but at the same time preserves the characteristic
features of quantum phenomena.”

The reader is introduced to the notion of a matrix in the
third paragraph of the introduction: “The mathematical basis
of Heisenberg’s treatment is the law of multiplication of
quantum-theoretical quantities, which he derived from an in-
genious consideration of correspondence arguments. The de-
velopment of his formalism, which we give here, is based
upon the fact that this rule of multiplication is none other
than the well-known mathematical rule of matrix multiplica-
tion. The infinite square array which appears at the start of
the next section, termed a matrix, is a representation of a
physical quantity which is given in classical theory as a func-
tion of time. The mathematical method of treatment inherent
in the new quantum mechanics is thereby characterized by
the employment of matrix analysis in place of the usual
number analysis.”

The Born-Jordan paper* is divided into four chapters.
Chapter | on “Matrix calculation” introduces the mathemat-
ics (algebra and calculus) of matrices to physicists. Chapter 2
on “Dynamics” establishes the fundamental postulates of
quantum mechanics, such as the law of commutation, and
derives the important theorems, such as the conservation of
energy. Chapter 3 on “Investigation of the anharmonic oscil-
lator” contains the first rigorous (correspondence free) calcu-
lation of the energy spectrum of a quantum-mechanical har-
monic oscillator. Chapter 4 on “Remarks = on
electrodynamics” contains a procedure—the first of its
kind—to quantize the electromagnetic field. We focus on the
material in Chap. 2 because it contains the essential physics
of matrix mechanics.

II. THE ORIGINAL POSTULATES OF QUANTUM
MECHANICS

Current presentations of quantum mechanics frequently
are based on a set of postulates.* The Born—Jordan postu-
lates of quantum mechanics were crafted before wave me-
chanics was formulated and thus are quite different than the
Schrédinger-based postulates in current textbooks. The origi-
nal postulates come as close as possible to the classical-
mechanical laws while maintaining complete quantum-
mechanical integrity.

Section Il, “The basic laws,” in Chap. 2 of the Born—
Jordan paper is five pages long and contains approximately
thirty equations. We have imposed a contemporary postula-
tory approach on this section by identifying five fundamental
passages from the text. We call these five fundamental ideas
“the postulates.” We have preserved the original phrasing,
notation, and logic of Born and Jordan. The labeling and the
naming of the postulates is ours.

Postulate 1. Position and Momentum. Born and Jordan
introduce the position and momentum matrices by writing
that*®

The dynamical system is to be described by the
spatial coordinate q and the momentum p, these
being represented by the matrices

2 ari v(aun)ty

(q=q(nm)e

(p = p(nm)e2™re)t) (2)

Here the (nm) denote the quantum-theoretical fre-
quencies associated with the transitions between
states described by the guantum numbers n and m.
The matrices (2) are to be Hermitian, e.g., on trans-
position of the matrices, each element is to go over
into its complex conjugate value, a condition
which should apply for all real t. We thus have

q(nm)q(mn) = |q(nm)|? (3)

and

v(nm) =— v(mn). (4)

If q is a Cartesian coordinate, then the expression
(3) is a measure of the probabilities of the transi-
tions n=m.

The preceding passage placed Hermitian matrices into the
physics limelight. Prior to the Born—Jordan paper, matrices
were rarely seen in physics.” Hermitian matrices were even
stranger. Physicists were reluctant to accept such an abstract
mathematical entity as a description of physical reality.

For Born and Jordan, q and p do not specify the position
and momentum of an electron in an atom. Heisenberg
stressed that quantum theory should focus only on the ob-
servable properties, namely the frequency and intensity of
the atomic radiation and not the position and period of the
electron. The quantities q and p represent position and mo-
mentum in the sense that q and p satisfy matrix equations of
motion that are identical in form to those satisfied by the

130 Am. J. Phys., Vol. 77, No. 2, February 2009

position and momentum of classical mechanics. In the Bohr
atom the electron undergoes periodic motion in a well de-
fined orbit around the nucleus with a certain classical fre-
quency. In the Heisenberg—Born—Jordan atom there is no
longer an orbit, but there is some sort of periodic “quantum
motion” of the electron characterized by the set of frequen-
cies v(nm) and amplitudes q(nm). Physicists believed that
something inside the atom must vibrate with the right fre-
quencies even though they could not visualize what the
quantum oscillations looked like. The mechanical properties
(q,p) of the quantum motion contain complete information
on the spectral properties (frequency, intensity) of the emit-
ted radiation.

The diagonal elements of a matrix correspond to the
states, and the off-diagonal elements correspond to the tran-
sitions. An important property of all dynamical matrices is
that the diagonal elements are independent of time. The Her-
mitian rule in Eq. (4) implies the relation v(nn)=0. Thus the
time factor of the nth diagonal term in any matrix is

27)! 1 As we shall see, the time-independent entries in
a diagonal matrix are related to the constant values of a con-
served quantity.

In their purely mathematical introduction to matrices
(Chap. 1), Born and Jordan use the following symbols to
denote a matrix

a(00) a(Ol) a(02)

a(10) a(11) a(12)
a=(a(nm)) = a(20) a(21) a(22) . (5)

The bracketed symbol (a(nm)), which displays inner ele-
ments a(nm) contained within outer brackets (), is the short-
hand notation for the array in Eq. (5). By writing the matrix
elements as a(nm), rather than a,,,,, Born and Jordan made
direct contact with Heisenberg’s quantum- theoretical quanti-
ties a(n,n—a) (see the Appendix). They wrote*? “Matrix
multiplication is defined by the rule ‘rows times columns,”
familiar from the ordinary theory of determinants:

Ed

a=be means a(nm) = >, b(nk)c(km) .” (6)
k=0

This multiplication rule was first given (for finite square ma-
trices) by Arthur Cayley.*° Little did Cayley know in 1855
that his mathematical “row times column” expression
b(nk)c(km) would describe the physical process of an elec-
tron making the transition n—k—m in an atom.

Born and Jordan wrote in Postulate 1 that the quantity
|q(nm)/? provides “a measure of the probabilities of the tran-
sitions nm. ” They justify this profound claim in the last
chapter.*” Born and Jordan’s one-line claim about transition
probabilities is the only statistical statement in their postu-
lates. Physics would have to wait several months before
Schrédinger’s wave function (x) and Born’s probability
function |W(x)|? entered the scene. Born discovered the con-
nection between |V(x)|? and position probability, and was
also the first physicist (with Jordan) to formalize the connec-
tion between |q(nm)|? and the transition probability via a
“quantum electrodynamic” argument.*® As a pioneer statisti-
cal interpreter of quantum mechanics, it is interesting to
speculate that Born might have discovered how to form a

William A. Fedak and Jeffrey J. Prentis 130

--- Page 4 ---
linear superposition of the periodic matrix elements
q(nm)e?7"""" in order to obtain another statistical object,
namely the expectation value (q). Early on, Born, Heisen-
berg, and Jordan did superimpose matrix elements,” but did
not supply the statistical interpretation.

Postulate 2. Frequency Combination Principle. After de-
fining q and p, Born and Jordan wrote” “Further, we shall
require that

v(jk) + v(kl) + v(lj) =0.” (7)

The frequency sum rule in Eq. (7) is the fundamental con-
straint on the quantum-theoretical frequencies. This rule is
based on the Ritz combination principle, which explains the
relations of the spectral lines of atomic spectroscopy." ° Equa-
tion (7) is the quantum analogue of the “Fourier combination
principle”, v(k—j)+v(I-k)+v({-)=0, where v(a)=avr(1)
is the frequency of the ath harmonic component of a Fourier
series. The frequency spectrum of classical periodic motion
obeys this Fourier sum rule. The equal Fourier spacing of
classical lines is replaced by the irregular Ritzian spacing of
quantal lines. In the correspondence limit of large quantum
numbers and small quantum jumps the atomic spectrum of
Ritz reduces to the harmonic spectrum of Fourier.*”° Be-
cause the Ritz rule was considered an exact law of atomic
spectroscopy, and because Fourier series played a vital role
in Heisenberg’s analysis, it made sense for Born and Jordan
to posit the frequency rule in Eq. (7) as a basic law.

One might be tempted to regard Eq. (7) as equivalent to
the Bohr frequency condition, E(n)-E(m)=hv(nm), where
E(n) is the energy of the nny state n. For Born and
Jordan, Eq. (7) says nothing about energy. They note that

Eqs. (4) and (7) imply that there exists spectral terms W,,
such that
hv(nm) = W,,- Wry. (8)

At this postulatory stage, the term W,, of the spectrum is
unrelated to the energy E(n) of the state. Heisenberg empha-
sized this distinction between “term” and ‘ “energy” in a letter
to Pauli summarizing the Born-Jordan theory.” Born and
Jordan adopt Eq. (7) as a postulate—one based solely on the
observable spectral quantities v(m) without reference to any
mechanical quantities E(n). The Bohr frequency condition is
not something they assume a priori, it is something that must
be rigorously proved.

The Ritz rule insures that the nm element of any dynami-
cal matrix (any function of p and q) oscillates with the same
frequency v(nm) as the nm element of p and q. For example,
if the 32 elements of p and q oscillate at 500 MHz, then
the 3—+2 elements of p?, q’, pq, q°, p?+q/, etc. each oscil-
late at 500 MHz. In all calculations involving the canonical
matrices p and q, no new frequencies are generated. A con-
sistent quantum theory must preserve the frequency spectrum
of a particular atom because the spectrum is the spectro-
scopic signature of the atom. The calculations must not
change the identity of the atom. Based on the rules for ma-
nipulating matrices and combining frequencies, Born and
Jordan wrote that “it follows that a function g(pq) invariably
takes on the form

=(g(nm)e2™ mm)t) °

and the matrix (g(nm)) therein results from identically the
same process applied to the matrices (g(nm)), (p(nm)) as

131 Am. J. Phys., Vol. 77, No. 2, February 2009

was employed to find g from q, p.”“” Because e27"""™ is the

universal time factor common to all dynamical matrices, they
note that it can be dropped from Eq. (2) in favor of the
shorter notation q=(q(nm)) and p=(p(nm)).

Why does the Ritz rule insure that the time factors of
g(pq) are identical to the time factors of p and q? Consider
the potential energy function q?. The nm element of q?,
which we denote by @(nm), is obtained from the elements of
q via the multiplication rule

q2(nm) = Dalnkye Ami Akt a (feyq) e2MIM I, (10)

Given the Ritz relation v(nm)=v(nk)+ (km), which follows
from Eqs. (4) and (7), Eq. (10) reduces to

q?(nm) = |= anki) |e (1)
k

It follows that the nm time factor of q? is the same as the nm
time factor of q.

We see that the theoretical rule for multiplying mechanical
amplitudes, a(nm)=>,b(nk)c(km), is intimately related to
the experimental rule for adding spectral frequencies,
v(nm)=v(nk)+ (km). The Ritz rule occupied a prominent
place in Heisenberg’s discovery of the multiplication rule
(see the Appendix). Whenever a contemporary physicist cal-
culates the total amplitude of the quantum jump n—k—m,
the steps involved can be traced back to the frequency com-
bination principle of Ritz.

Postulate 3. The Equation of Motion. Born and Jordan
introduce the law of quantum dynamics by writing®®

In the case of a Hamilton function having the form

1
=5,,P*+Ulq), (12)
m

we shall assume, as did Heisenberg, that the equa-
tions of motion have just the same form as in the
classical theory, so that we can write:

. Al (13a)
=—=—p, a
q ap nP
HAH wv
p=-—=-—. (13b)
aq aq

This Hamiltonian formulation of quantum dynamics general-
ized Heisenberg’s Newtonian approach." The assumption by
Heisenberg and Born and Jordan that quantum dynamics
looks the same as classical dynamics was a bold and deep
assumption. For them, the problem with classical mechanics
was not the dynamics (the form of the equations of motion),
but rather the kinematics (the meaning of position and mo-
mentum).

Postulate 4. Energy Spectrum. Born and Jordan reveal the
connection between the allowed energies of a conservative
system and the numbers in the Hamiltonian matrix:

“The diagonal elements H(nn) of H are inter-
preted, according to Heisenberg, as the energies of
the various states of the system.”

William A. Fedak and Jeffrey J. Prentis 131

--- Page 5 ---
This statement introduced a radical new idea into main-
stream physics: calculating an energy spectrum reduces to
finding the components of a diagonal matrix.*° Although
Born and Jordan did not mention the word eigenvalue in Ref.
4, Born, Heisenberg, and Jordan would soon formalize the
idea of calculating an energy spectrum by solving an eigen-
value problem.° The ad hoc rules for calculating a quantized
energy in the old quantum theory were replaced by a system-
atic mathematical program.

Born and Jordan considered exclusively conservative sys-
tems for which H does not depend explicitly on time. The
connection between conserved quantities and diagonal matri-
ces will be discussed later. For now, recall that the diagonal
elements of any matrix are independent of time. For the spe-
cial case where all the non-diagonal elements of a dynamical
matrix g(pq) vanish, the quantity g is a constant of the mo-
tion. A postulate must be introduced to specify the physical
meaning of the constant elements in g.

In the old quantum theory it was difficult to explain why
the energy was quantized. The discontinuity in energy had to
be postulated or artificially imposed. Matrices are naturally
quantized. The quantization of energy is built into the dis-
crete row-column structure of the matrix array. In the old
theory Bohr’s concept of a stationary state of energy E,, was
a central concept. Physicists grappled with the questions:
Where does E,, fit into the theory? How is E,, calculated?
Bohr’s concept of the energy of the stationary state finally
found a rigorous place in the new matrix scheme.

Postulate 5. The Quantum Condition. Born and Jordan
state that the elements of p and q for any quantum mechani-
cal system must satisfy the “quantum condition”:

© (pink) glbn) — glnkplkn)) = 5. (14)

Given the significance of Eq. (14) in the development of
quantum mechanics, we quote Born and Jordan’s “deriva-
tion” of this equation:

The equation

the Fourier expansions of p and q,

The following expressions should correspond:

where in the right-hand expression those q(nm),
p(nm) which take on a negative index are to be set
equal to zero. In this way we obtain the quantiza-
tion condition corresponding to Eq. (17) as

D (pinkalbn)— glnkptkm)) =~. 20)
i Ti

This is a system of infinitely many equations,
namely one for each value of nJ®

Why did Born and Jordan take the derivative of the action
integral in Eq. (15) to arrive at Eq. (17)? Heisenberg per-
formed a similar maneuver (see the Appendix). One reason is
to eliminate any explicit dependence on the integer variable
n from the basic laws. Another reason is to generate a differ-
ential expression that can readily be translated via the corre-
spondence principle into a difference expression containing
only transition quantities. In effect, a state relation is con-
verted into a change-in-state relation. In the old quantum
theory the Bohr-Sommerfeld quantum condition, pdg=nh,
determined how all state quantities depend on n. Such an ad
hoc quantization algorithm has no proper place in a rigorous
quantum theory, where n should not appear explicitly in any
of the fundamental laws. The way in which q(nm), p(nm),
v(nm) depend on (nm) should not be artificially imposed, but
should be naturally determined by fundamental relations in-
volving only the canonical variables q and p, without any
explicit dependence on the state labels n and m. Equation
(20) is one such fundamental relation.

In 1924 Born introduced the technique of replacing differ-
entials by differences to make the “formal passage from clas-
sical mechanics to a ‘quantum mechanics’.”"” This corre-
spondence rule played an important role in allowing Born
and others to develop the equations of quantum mechanics.~’
To motivate Born’s rule note that the fundamental orbital
frequency of a classical periodic system is equal to dE/dJ (E
is energy and J=¢pdq is an action)! whereas the spectral
frequency of an atomic system is equal to AE/h. Hence, the
passage from a classical to a quantum frequency is made by
replacing the derivative dE/dJ by the difference AE/h.
Born conjectured that this correspondence is valid for any
quantity ®. He wrote “We are therefore as good as forced to
adopt the rule that we have to replace a classically calculated
quantity, whenever it is of the form 7d®/0J by the_linear
average or difference quotient [®(n+7)-®(n)|/h.” The
correspondence between Eqs. (18) and (19) follows from

William A. Fedak and Jeffrey J. Prentis 132

--- Page 6 ---
Born’s rule by letting ® be ®(n)=g(n,n-7)p(n-7,n),
where g(n,n—7) corresponds to g, and p(n—7,n) corre-
sponds to p_, or p..

Born and Jordan remarked that Eq. (20) implies that p and
q can never be finite matrices.” For the special case p
=mgq they also noted that the general condition in Eq. (20)
reduces to Heisenberg’s form of the quantum condition (see
the Appendix). Heisenberg did not realize that his quantiza-
tion rule was a relation between pq and qp.>

Planck’s constant / enters into the theory via the quantum
condition in Eq. (20). The quantum condition expresses the
following deep law of nature: All the diagonal components of
Pq—qp must equal the universal constant h/2 ai.

What about the nondiagonal components of pq—qp? Born
claimed that they were all equal to zero. Jordan proved
Born’s claim. It is important to emphasize that Postulate 5
says nothing about the nondiagonal elements. Born and Jor-
dan were careful to distinguish the postulated statements
(laws of nature) from the derivable results (consequences of
the postulates). Born’s development of the diagonal part of
pq-—gqp and Jordan’s derivation of the nondiagonal part con-
stitute the two-part discovery of the law of commutation.

IV. THE LAW OF COMMUTATION

Born and Jordan write the following equation in Sec. IV of
“On quantum mechanics”:

h
Pq-ap= 57 “1. (21)
T1

They call Eq. (21) the “sharpened quantum condition” be-
cause it sharpened the condition in Eq. (20), which only fixes
the diagonal elements, to one which fixes all the elements. In
a letter to Pauli, Heisenberg referred to Eq. (21) as a “fun-
damental law of this mechanics” and as “Born’s very clever
idea.””° Indeed, the commutation law in Eq. (21) is one of
the most fundamental relations in quantum mechanics. This
equation introduces Planck’s constant and the imaginary
number i into the theory in the most basic way possible. It is
the golden rule of quantum algebra and makes quantum cal-
culations unique. The way in which all dynamical properties
of a system depend on / can be traced back to the simple
way in which pq—qp depend on A. In short, the commuta-
tion law in Eq. (21) stores information on the discontinuity,
the non-commutativity, the uncertainty, and the complexity
of the quantum world.

In their paper Born and Jordan proved that the off-
diagonal elements of pq—qp are equal to zero by first estab-
lishing a “diagonality theorem,” which they state as follows:
“If v(nm)#0 when n#m, a condition which we wish to
assume, then the formula g=0 denotes that g is a diagonal
matrix with g(nm)=6,,g(nn).”>’ This theorem establishes
the connection between the structural (diagonality) and the
temporal (constancy) properties of a dynamical matrix. It
provided physicists with a whole new way to look at conser-
vation principles: Jn quantum mechanics, conserved quanti-
ties are represented by diagonal matrices.

Born and Jordan proved the diagonality theorem as fol-
lows. Because all dynamical matrices g(pq) have the form in
Eq. (9), the time derivative of g is

133 Am. J. Phys., Vol. 77, No. 2, February 2009

& =27i(v(nm)g(nm)e2™"").. (22)

If g=0, then Eq. (22) implies the relation »(nm)g(nm)=0 for
all (nm). This relation is always true for the diagonal ele-
ments because v(nn) is always equal to zero. For the off-
diagonal elements, the relation v(nm)g(nm)=0 implies that
g(nm) must equal zero, because it is assumed that v(nm)
#0 for n#m. Thus, g is a diagonal matrix.

Hence, to show that pq—qp is a diagonal matrix, Born
and Jordan showed that the time derivative of pq—gqp is
equal to zero. They introduced the matrix d=pq-—gqp and
expressed the time derivative of d as

d= pq + pq- 4p — ap. (23)
They used the canonical equations of motion in Eq. (13) to
write Eq. (23) as

d=a - Sas pata. (24)

aq oq op op

They next demonstrated that the combination of derivatives
in Eq. (24) leads to a vanishing result” and say that “

follows that d=0 and d is a diagonal matrix. The dinsonal
elements of d are, however, specified by the quantum condi-
tion (20). Summarizing, we obtain the equation

Pq - 4p = ty (25)
2a

on introducing the unit matrix 1. We call Eq. (25) the ‘sharp-

nes quantum condition’ and base all further conclusions on

° Fundamental results that propagate from Eq. (25) in-

clude the equation of motion, g=(27i/h)(Hg—gH) (see Sec.

V), the Heisenberg uncertainty principle, ApAqg=h/47, and
the Schrédinger operator, p=(h/277i)d/dq.

It is important to emphasize the two distinct origins of
pq-qp=(h/27i)1. The diagonal part, (pq—qP)aiagonal
=h/277i is a law—an exact decoding of the approximate law
¢pdqz=nh. The nondiagonal part, (Pq—QP)nondiagonal=9, iS a
theorem—a logical consequence of the equations of motion.
From a practical point of view Eq. (25) represents vital in-
formation on the line spectrum of an atom by defining a
system of algebraic equations that place strong constraints on
the magnitudes of g(nm), p(nm), and v(nm).

V. THE EQUATION OF MOTION

Born and Jordan proved that the equation of motion de-
scribing the time evolution of any dynamical quantity g(pq)
is

oni
= =~ (He- gH). (26)

Equation (26) is now often referred to as the Heisenberg
equation.° "In Ref. 2 the only equation of motion is Newton’s
second law, which Heisenberg wrote as ¥+f(x)=0 (see the
Appendix).

The “commutator” of mechanical quantities is a recurring
theme in the Born—Jordan theory. The quantity pq—qp lies at
the core of their theory. Equation (26) reveals how the quan-
tity Hg—gH is synonymous with the time evolution of g.
Thanks to Born and Jordan, as well as Dirac who established
the connection between commutators and classical Poisson

--- Page 7 ---
brackets,° the commutator is now an integral part of modern
quantum theory. The change in focus from commuting vari-
ables to noncommuting variables represents a paradigm shift
in quantum theory.

The original derivation of Eq. (26) is different from
present-day derivations. In the usual textbook presentation
Eq. (26) is derived from a unitary transformation of the states
and operators in the Schrodinger picture.” “In 1925, the
Schrédinger picture did not exist. To derive Eq. (26) from
their postulates Born and Jordan developed a new quantum-
theoretical technology that is now referred to as ““commuta-
tor algebra.” They began the proof by stating the following
generalizations of Eq. (25):

h
P’q=qp"+n5—p"", (27)

h

a'p = pq" —n>—4"", (28)
which can readily be derived by induction. They considered
Hamiltonians of the form

H=H,(p) + Ho(q), (29)
where H,(p) and H,(q) are represented by power series
H,= >> ap",
5
H= > bq’. (30)
5

After writing these expressions, they wrote” “Formulae (27)

and (28) indicate that

H H=——, 31
4-qH= 5p (31)
H H = a (32)
Pe oni aq”
Comparison with the equations of motion (13) yields
_ Qa
a= (Haq), (33)
Qa
b= ——(Hp - pH). (34)
Denoting the matrix Hg—gH by lel for brevity, one has
H H H
= b+al_ |, (35)
ab a
from which generally for g=g(pq) one may conclude that
2mi|H| 27
=F |—]/ =) (He-sH).” (36)

The derivation of Eq. (36) clearly displays Born and Jordan’s
expertise in commutator algebra. The essential step to go
from Eq. (27) to Eq. (31) is to note that Eq. (27) can be
rewritten as a commutator-derivative relation, p"q—qp”
=(h/277i)dp"/dp, which is equivalent to the nth term of the
series representation of Eq. (31). The generalized commuta-
tion rules in Eqs. (27) and (28), and the relation between

134 Am. J. Phys., Vol. 77, No. 2, February 2009

commutators and derivatives in Eqs. (31) and (32) are now
standard operator equations of contemporary quantum
theory.

With the words, “Denoting the matrix Hg—gH by lh
Born and Jordan formalized the notion of a commutator and
introduced physicists to this important quantum-theoretical
object. The appearance of Eq. (36) in Ref. 4 marks the first
printed statement of the general equation of motion for a
dynamical quantity in quantum mechanics.

VI. THE ENERGY THEOREMS

Heisenberg, Born, and Jordan considered the conservation
of energy and the Bohr frequency condition as universal laws
that should emerge as logical consequences of the fundamen-
tal postulates. Proving energy conservation and the fre-
quency condition was the ultimate measure of the power of
the postulates and the validity of the theory. Born and Jor-
dan began Sec. IV of Ref. 4 by writing “The content of the
preceding paragraphs furnishes the basic rules of the new
quantum mechanics in their entirety. All the other laws of
quantum mechanics, whose general validity is to be verified,
must be derivable from these basic tenets. As instances of
such laws to be proved, the law of energy conservation and
the Bohr frequency condition primarily enter into
consideration.”

The energy theorems are stated as follows:

H=0 (energy conservation), (37)

hv(nm) = H(nn) - H(mm) (frequency condition). (38)

Equations (37) and (38) are remarkable statements on the
temporal behavior of the system and the logical structure of
the theory. Equation (37) says that H, which depends on
the matrices p and q is always a constant of the motion even
though p=p(¢) and q=q(t) depend on time. In short, the ¢ in
H(p(1),q(t)) must completely disappear. Equation (37) re-
veals the time independence of H, and Eq. (38) specifies how
H itself determines the time dependence of all other dynami-
cal quantities.

Why should v(nm), H(nn), and H(mm) be related? These
quantities are completely different structural elements of dif-
ferent matrices. The parameter v(m) is a transition quantity
that characterizes the off-diagonal, time-dependent part of q
and p. In contrast, H(nn) is a state quantity that characterizes
the diagonal, time-independent part of H(pq). It is a non-
trivial claim to say that these mechanical elements are re-
lated.

It is important to distinguish between the Bohr meaning of
E,-E,=hv and the Born—Jordan meaning of H(nn)
—H(mm)=hv(nm). For Bohr, E, denotes the mechanical en-
ergy of the electron and v denotes the spectral frequency of
the radiation. In the old quantum theory there exists ad hoc,
semiclassical rules to calculate E,. There did not exist any
mechanical rules to calculate v, independent of E,, and E,,.
The relation between E,,—E,, and v was postulated. Born and
Jordan did not postulate any connection between H(nn),
H(mm), and v(nm). The basic mechanical laws (law of mo-
tion and law of commutation) allow them to calculate the
frequencies (nm) which paramaterize q and the energies
H(nn) stored in H. The theorem in Eq. (38) states that the

William A. Fedak and Jeffrey J. Prentis 134

--- Page 8 ---
calculated values of the mechanical parameters H(nn),
H(mm), and v(nm) will always satisfy the relation H(nn)
—H(mm)=hv(nm).

The equation of motion (36) is the key to proving the
energy theorems. Born and Jordan wrote “In particular, if in
Eq. (36) we set g=H, we obtain

H=0. (39)

Now that we have verified the energy-conservation law and
recognized the matrix H to be diagonal [by the diagonality
theorem, H=0=H is diagonal], Eqs. (33) and (34) can be
put into the form

hv(nm)q(nm) = (A(nn) — H(mm))q(nm), (40)

hv(nm)p(nm) = (H(nn) — H(mm))p(nm), (41)

from which the frequency condition follows.”®” Given the
importance of this result, it is worthwhile to elaborate on the
proof. Because the nm component of any matrix g is
g(nm)e27""™)", the nm component of the matrix relation in
Eq. (33) is

Qui v(nm)q(nm)e2™""

= TY (H(nk)qlkm)
k

= q(nk)H(k) e274 ken (42)

Given the diagonality of H, A(nk)=H(nn)6,, and H(km)
=H(mm) 6», and the Ritz rule, v(nk)+v(km)=v(nm), Eq.
(42) reduces to

v(nm) = = (H(an) —H(mm)). (43)

In this way Born and Jordan demonstrated how Bohr’s fre-
quency condition, hv(nm)=H(nn)—H(mm), is simply a sca-
lar component of the matrix equation, hq=27i(Hq-qH). In
any presentation of quantum mechanics it is important to
explain how and where Bohr’s frequency condition logically
fits into the formal structure.°*

According to Postulate 4, the nth diagonal element H(nn)
of H is equal to the energy of the nth stationary state. Logi-
cally, this postulate is needed to interpret Eq. (38) as the
original frequency condition conjectured by Bohr. Born and
Jordan note that Eqs. (8) and (38) imply that the mechanical
energy H(nn) is related to the spectral term W,, as follows:
W,,=H(nn)+constant.”

This mechanical proof of the Bohr frequency condition
established an explicit connection between time evolution
and energy. In the matrix scheme all mechanical quantities
(p, q, and g(pq)) evolve in time via the set of factors
e2munm)t where v(nm)=(H(nn)—H(mm))/h. Thus, all
g-functions have the form”?

g= (g(nm)e2™Hn—Hlmm))tihy (44)

Equation (44) exhibits how the difference in energy between
state n and state m is the “driving force” behind the time
evolution (quantum oscillations) associated with the change
of state nm.

In the introduction of their paper, Born and Jordan write
“With the aid of [the equations of motion and the quantum

135 Am. J. Phys., Vol. 77, No. 2, February 2009

condition], one can prove the general validity of the law of
conservation of energy and the Bohr frequency relation in the
sense conjectured by Heisenberg: this proof could not be
carried through in its entirety by him even for the simple
examples which he considered.” ' Because p and q do not
commute, the mechanism responsible for energy conserva-
tion in quantum mechanics is significantly different than the
classical mechanism. Born and Jordan emphasize this differ-
ence by writing “Whereas in classical mechanics energy con-

servation (H=0) is directly apparent from the canonical
equations, the same law of energy conservation in quantum

mechanics, H=0 lies, as one can see, more deeply hidden
beneath the surface. That its demonstrability from the as-
sumed postulates is far from being trivial will be appreciated
if, following more closely the classical method of proof, one

sets out to prove H to be constant simply by evaluating H””?
We carry out Born and Jordan’s suggestion “to prove H to

be constant simply by evaluating H” for the special Hamil-
tonian

H=p'+q°. (45)

In order to focus on the energy calculus of the p and q
matrices, we have omitted the scalar coefficients in Eq. (45).

If we write Eq. (45) as H=pp+qqq, calculate H, and use the
equations of motion q=2p, p=—3q?, we find”

H = q(pq- ap) + (qp - pa)a. (46)
Equation (46) reveals how the value of pq—qp uniquely
determines the value of H. The quantum condition, pq—qp

=(h/277i)1, reduces Eq. (46) to H=0. In classical mechanics
the classical condition, pqg—qp=0, is taken for granted in
proving energy conservation. In quantum mechanics the con-
dition that specifies the nonzero value of pq—qp plays a
nontrivial role in establishing energy conservation. This non-
triviality is what Born and Jordan meant when they wrote
that energy conservation in quantum mechanics “lies more
deeply hidden beneath the surface.”

Proving the law of energy conservation and the Bohr fre-
quency condition was the decisive test of the theory—the
final validation of the new quantum mechanics. All of the
pieces of the “quantum puzzle” now fit together. After prov-
ing the energy theorems, Born and Jordan wrote that “The
fact that energy-conservation and frequency laws could be
proved in so general a context would seem to us to furnish
strong grounds to hope that this theory embraces truly deep-
seated physical laws.””*

VII. CONCLUSION

To put the discovery of quantum mechanics in matrix form
into perspective, we summarize the contributions of Heisen-
berg and Born—Jordan. Heisenberg’s breakthrough consists
of four quantum-theoretical reinterpretations (see the Appen-
dix):

1. Replace the position coordinate x(t) by the set of transi-
tion components a(n,n— ae",
2. Replace x°(t) with the set L,a(n,n-a)eio'"a(n

_ a,n— Beira PI,

3. Keep Newton’s second law, +/(x)=0, but replace x as
before.

4. Replace the old quantum condition, nh=mxdt, with h
=4am> fla(nta,n)?o(n+a,n)—la(n,n—a)Po(n,n

—a)}.

The quantum mechanics of Born and Jordan consists of
five postulates:

qz= (q(nm) e277?) p=(p(nm)e27""™),
v(jk) + v(kl) + (lj) =0,

4=0H/ op, p=-dH/ aq,

E,,=H(nn), and

(P9-4P) giagona=// 27,

YRYN ES

and four theorems

1. (PQ GP) nondiagonar=0;

2. g=(27i/h)(Hg-gH),

3. H=0, and

4. hv(nm)=H(nn)-H(mm).

Quantum mechanics evolved at a rapid pace after the pa-
pers of Heisenberg and Born—Jordan. Dirac’s paper was re-
ceived on 7 November 1925.° Born, Heisenberg, and Jor-
dan’s paper was received on 16 November 1925. The first
“textbook” on quantum mechanics appeared in 1926.” Ina
series of papers during the spring of 1926, Schrédinger set
forth the theory of wave mechanics.” In a paper received
June 25, 1926 Born introduced the statistical interpretation of
the wave function.’’ The Nobel Prize was awarded to
Heisenberg in 1932 (delayed until 1933) to Schrédinger and
Dirac in 1933, and to Born in 1954.

APPENDIX: HEISENBERG’S FOUR
BREAKTHROUGH IDEAS

We divide Heisenberg’s paper” into four major reinterpre-
tations. For the most part we will preserve Heisenberg’s
original notation and arguments.

Reinterpretation 1: Position. Heisenberg considered one-
dimensional periodic systems. The classical motion of the
system (in a stationary state labeled n) is described by the
time-dependent position x(n, ny.’ Heisenberg represents this
periodic function by the Fourier series

x(n, =>, a,(njeion", (Al)

Unless otherwise noted, sums over integers go from —~ to ~.
The ath Fourier component related to the nth stationary state
has amplitude a,(n) and frequency aw(n). According to the
correspondence principle, the ath Fourier component of the
classical motion in the state n corresponds to the quantum
jump from state n to state n—a@. 826 Motivated by this prin-
ciple, Heisenberg replaced the classical component
ag(nye" by the transition component —a(n,n
-a)eio- We could say that the Fourier harmonic is
replaced by a “Heisenberg harmonic.” Unlike the sum over
the classical components in Eq. (Al), Heisenberg realized
that a similar sum over the transition components is mean-
ingless. Such a quantum Fourier series could not describe the
electron motion in one stationary state (n) because each term
in the sum describes a transition process associated with two
states (n and n-a).

Heisenberg’s next step was bold and ingenious. Instead of

136 Am. J. Phys., Vol. 77, No. 2, February 2009

reinterpreting x(t) as a swm over transition components, he
represented the position by the ser of transition components.
We symbolically denote Heisenberg’s reinterpretation as

(A2)

x — fa(n, n— aeionn on.
Equation (A2) is the first breakthrough relation.

Reinterpretation 2: Multiplication. To calculate the energy
of a harmonic oscillator, Heisenberg needed to know the
quantity x’. How do you square a set of transition compo-
nents? Heisenberg posed this fundamental question twice in
his paper.* ° His answer gave birth to the algebraic structure
of quantum mechanics. We restate Heisenberg’s question as
“If x is represented by {a(n,n—a)ei""-"} and x? is repre-
sented by {b(n,n— Bei"), how is b(n,n—£) related to
a(n,n—a)?”

Heisenberg answered this question by reinterpreting the
square of a Fourier series with the help of the Ritz principle.
He evidently was convinced that quantum multiplication,
whatever it looked like, must reduce to Fourier-series multi-
plication in the classical limit. The square of Eq. (A1) gives

x?(n,t) = = bolnyebo, (A3)
where the Sth Fourier amplitude is
bol) =X ag(n)ap_aln). (A4)

@

In the new quantum theory Heisenberg replaceed Eqs. (A3)
and (A4) with

= {d(n,n- peer", (AS)
where the n—n-f transition amplitude is
b(nsn- B) => a(n,n- a)a(n- a,n- B). (A6)

a

In constructing Eq. (A6) Heisenberg uncovered the symbolic
algebra of atomic processes.
The logic behind the quantum rule of multiplication can be
summarized as follows. Ritz’s sum rule for atomic frequen-
cies, w(n,n-B)=o0(n,n-a)+(n—a,n-B), implies the
product rule for Heisenberg’s kinematic elements, e("~9)!
= elolnn-a)igio(n—a.n-B)! which is the backbone of the multipli-
cation rule in Eq. (A6). Equation (A6) allowed Heisenberg to
algebraically manipulate the transition components.
Reinterpretation 3: Motion. Equations (A2), (A5), and
(A6) represent the new “kinematics” of quantum theory—the
new meaning of the position x. Heisenberg next turned his
attention to the new “mechanics.” The goal of Heisenberg’s
mechanics is to determine the amplitudes, frequencies, and
energies from the given forces. Heisenberg noted that in the
old quantum theory a,(7) and w(n) are determined by soly-
ing the classical equation of motion

#+ f(x) =0

and quantizing the classical solution—making it depend on
n—via the quantum condition

p mxdx =nh.

In Eqs. (A7) and (A8)
and m is the mass.

(A7)

(A8)

f(x) is the force (per mass) function

William A. Fedak and Jeffrey J. Prentis 136

--- Page 10 ---
Heisenberg assumed that Newton’s second law in Eq. (A7)
is valid in the new quantum theory provided that the classical
quantity x is replaced by the set of quantities in Eq. (A2), and
f(x) is calculated according to the new rules of amplitude
algebra. Keeping the same form of Newton’s law of dynam-
ics, but adopting the new kinematic meaning of x is the third
Heisenberg breakthrough.

Reinterpretation 4: Quantization. How did Heisenberg re-
interpret the old quantization condition in Eq. (A8)? Given
the Fourier series in Eq. (A1), the quantization condition,
nh= ¢mx"dt, can be expressed in terms of the Fourier param-
eters a,(n) and w(n) as

nh=20m>, lag(n)?a? o(n). (A9)

For Heisenberg, setting $pdx equal to an integer multiple of
h was an arbitrary rule that did not fit naturally into the
dynamical scheme. Because his theory focuses exclusively
on transition quantities, Heisenberg needed to translate the
old quantum condition that fixes the properties of the states
to a new condition that fixes the properties of the transitions
between states. Heisenberg believed'* that what matters is
the difference between pdx evaluated for neighboring
states: [fpdx],,-[fpdx],,_;. He therefore took the derivative
of Eq. (A9) with respect to n to eliminate the forced n de-
pendence and to produce a differential relation that can be
reinterpreted as a difference relation between transition
quantities. In short, Heisenberg converted

h=27m> a (la,(n)Paw(n)) (A10)
a an
to
h=4am>, {la(n + a,n)Po(n + a,n)
a=0
—|a(n,n- a)|?o(n,n - a)}. (All)

In a sense Heisenberg’s “amplitude condition” in Eq. (A11)
is the counterpart to Bohr’s frequency condition (Ritz’s fre-
quency combination rule). Heisenberg’s condition relates the
amplitudes of different lines within an atomic spectrum and
Bohr’s condition relates the frequencies. Equation (A11) is
the fourth Heisenberg breakthrough.*!

Equations (A7) and (A11) constitute Heisenberg’s new
mechanics. In principle, these two equations can be solved to
find a(n,n—a@) and w(n,n-a). No one before Heisenberg
knew how to calculate the amplitude of a quantum jump.
Equations (A2), (A6), (A7), and (A11) define Heisenberg’s
program for constructing the line spectrum of an atom from
the given force on the electron.

The name “matrix mechanics” did not appear in the original papers of
1925 and 1926. The new mechanics was most often called “quantum

mechanics.” At Géttingen, some began to call it “matrix physics.”
Heisenberg disliked this terminology and tried to eliminate the math-
ematical term “matrix” from the subject in favor of the physical expres-
sion “quantum-theoretical magnitude.” [Ref. 17, p. 362]. In his Nobel
Lecture delivered 11 December 1933, Heisenberg referred to the two
versions of the new mechanics as “quantum mechanics” and “wave me-
chanics.” See Nobel Lectures in Physics 1922-194] (Elsevier, Amster-

In Heisenberg’s paper (see Ref. 2) the connection between |q(nm)|? and
transition probability is implied but not discussed. See Ref. 3, pp. 30-32,
for a discussion of Heisenberg’s assertion that the transition amplitudes
determine the transition probabilibities. The relation between a squared
amplitude and a transition probability originated with Bohr who conjec-
tured that the squared Fourier amplitude of the classical electron motion
provides a measure of the transition probability (see Refs. 8 and 26). The
correspondence between classical intensities and quantum probabilities
was studied by several physicists including H. Kramers, Intensities of
Spectral Lines (A. F. Host and Sons, Kobenhaven, 1919); R. Ladenburg
in Ref. 3, paper 4, and J. H. Van Vleck, “Quantum principles and line
spectra,” Bulletin of the National Research Council, Washington, DC,
1926, pp. 118-153.

237-243 (1908). The Ritz combination principle was crucial in making
sense of the regularities in the line spectra of atoms. It was a key principle
that guided Bohr in constructing a quantum theory of line spectra. Ob-
servations of spectral lines revealed that pairs of line frequencies combine
(add) to give the frequency of another line in the spectrum. The Ritz
combination rule is v(nk)+v(km)= (nm), which follows from Eqs. (4)
and (7). As a universal, exact law of spectroscopy, the Ritz rule provided
a powerful tool to analyze spectra and to discover new lines. Given the
measured frequencies vy; and vy, of two known lines in a spectrum, the
Ritz rule told spectroscopists to look for new lines at the frequencies 1;

sumed that W is the energy.” See Ref. 3, p. 45.

“Born and Jordan devote a large portion of Chap. 1 to developing a matrix
calculus to give meaning to matrix derivatives such as dq/dt and dH/ op.
They introduce the process of “symbolic differentiation” for constructing
the derivative of a matrix with respect to another matrix. For a discussion
of Born and Jordan’s matrix calculus, see Ref. 13, pp. 68-71. To deal
with arbitrary Hamiltonian functions, Born and Jordan formulated a more
general dynamical law by converting the classical action principal,
SLdt=extremum, into a quantal action principal, D(pq—H(pq))
=extremum, where D denotes the trace (diagonal sum) of the Lagrangian
matrix, pq—H. See Ref. 3, pp. 289-290.

Reference 3, p. 292. This statement by Born and Jordan appears in Sec.
IV of their paper following the section on the basic laws. We have in-
cluded it with the postulates because it is a deep assumption with far-
reaching consequences.

In contemporary language the states labeled n=0,1,2,3,... in Heisen-
berg’s paper and the Born—Jordan paper are exact stationary states (eigen-
states of H). The Hamiltonian matrix is automatically a diagonal matrix
with respect to this basis.

“7 Although Heisenberg, Born, and Jordan made the “energy of the state”
and the “transition between states” rigorous concepts, it was Schrédinger
who formalized the concept of the “state” itself. It is interesting to note
that “On quantum mechanics II” by Born, Heisenberg, and Jordan was
published before Schrédinger and implicitly contains the first mathemati-
cal notion of a quantum state. In this paper (Ref. 3, pp. 348-353), each
Hermitian matrix a is associated with a “bilinear form” Enmanm)x x
Furthermore, they identified the “energy spectrum” of a system with the
set of “eigenvalues” W in the equation Wx,— ,H(k/)x,=0. In present-day
symbolic language the bilinear form and eigenvalue problem are (V|a|‘V)
and H|‘V)=W|'P), respectively, where the variables x,, are the expansion
coefficients of the quantum state |W). At the time, they did not realize the
physical significance of their eigenvector (x,,x7,...) as representing a
stationary state.

This is the sentence from Born’s 1924 paper (See Ref. 1) where the name
“quantum mechanics” appears for the first time in the physics literature
[Ref. 3, p. 182].

The exact relation between the orbital frequency and the optical fre-
quency is derived as follows. Consider the transition from state n of
energy E(n) to state n—7 of energy E(n-7). In the limit n> 7, that is,
large “orbit” and small “jump,” the difference E(n)—E(n-7) is equal to
the derivative 7dE/dn. Given the old quantum condition J=nh, it follows
that dE/dn=hdE/dJ. Thus for n> 7 and J=nh, we have the relation
[E(n)-E(n-7)]/h=7dE/dJ, or equivalently, v(n,n—7)=7v(n). This rela-
tion proves an important correspondence theorem: In the limit n> 7, the
frequency »(n,n—7) associated with the quantum jump n—n-7 is equal
to the frequency 7v(n) associated with the 7th harmonic of the classical
motion in the state n. See Refs. 8 and 26.

*4Suppose that the number of states is finite and equal to the integer N.
Then, according to Eq. (20), the diagonal sum (trace) of pq—qp would be
D(pq-qp)=Nh/27i. This nonzero value of the trace contradicts the
purely mathematical relation D(pq—qp)=0, which must be obeyed by all
finite matrices.

The condition v(nm) #0 when n#m implies that the system is nonde-

*Tn contemporary language a conserved quantity is an operator that com-
mutes with the Hamiltonian operator H. For such commuting operators
there exists a common set of eigenvectors. In the energy eigenbasis that
underlies the Born—Jordan formulation, the matrices representing H and
all conserved quantities are automatically diagonal.

Born and Jordan’s proof that Eq. (24) vanishes is based on a purely
mathematical property of “symbolic differentiation” discussed in Sec. II
of their paper (See Ref. 4). For a separable Hamiltonian of the form H

=p?/2m+U(q), the proof is simpler. For this case Eq. (24) becomes d

=q(dU/dq)—(JU/dq)q+p(p/m)-(p/m)p. Because p and q are sepa-

rated in this expression, we do not have to consider the inequality pq

#qp. The expression reduces to d=0.

Reference 3, p. 292, paper 13. In Ref. 4, Born and Jordan refer to pq

-qp=(h/27i)1 as the “vershirfte Quantenbedingung,” which has been

translated as “sharpened quantum condition” (Ref. 13, p. 77), “stronger

quantum condition” (Ref. 3, p. 292), and “exact quantum condition” (Ref.

12, p. 220).

° Proving the frequency condition—the second general principle of Bohr—
was especially important because this purely quantal condition was gen-
erally regarded as a safely established part of physics. Prior to Born and
Jordan’s mechanical proof of the frequency condition, there existed a
“thermal proof” given by Einstein in his historic paper, “On the quantum
theory of radiation,” Phys. Z. 18, 121 (1917), translated in Ref. 3, pp,
63-77. In this paper Einstein provides a completely new derivation of
Planck’s thermal radiation law by introducing the notion of transition
probabilities (A and B coefficients). Bohr’s frequency condition emerges
as the condition necessary to reduce the Boltzmann factor exp[(E,
-E,,)/kT] in Einstein’s formula to the “Wien factor” exp(hv/kT) in
Planck’s formula.

Instead of postulating the equations of motion and deriving the energy

theorems, we could invert the proof and postulate the energy theorems

and derive the equations of motion. This alternate logic is mentioned in

Ref. 3, p. 296 and formalized in Ref. 5 (Ref. 3, p. 329). Also see J. H. Van

H(pq) and discover the need to symmetrize the functions. For example,
for H*=p’q, it does not follow that H*=0. However, they note that H
=(p°q+qp’)/2 yields the same equations of motion as H* and also con-
serves energy, H=0. The symmetrization rule reflects the noncommuta-
tivity of p and q.

°SIn the Heisenberg, Born-Jordan approach the transition components of
the “matter variables” q and p are simply assumed to oscillate in time
with the radiation frequencies. In contemporary texts a rigorous proof of
Bohr’s frequency condition involves an analysis of the interaction be-
tween matter and radiation (radiative transitions) using time-dependent
perturbation theory. See Ref. 24, Chap. 19.

Using the language of state vectors and bra-kets, the matrix element of an
operator g is g,,,(t)=(V,,(0|g/V,,(), where the energy eigenstate is
|W,())=exp(—2 7iE,,t/h)|V,,(0)). This Schrédinger element is equivalent
to the Born—Jordan element in Eq. (44).

ergy conservation and Bohr’s frequency condition for two systems (an-
harmonic oscillator and rotator). The anharmonic oscillator analysis was
limited to second-order perturbation theory.

noting that for the most general Hamiltonians the calculation “becomes
so exceedingly involved that it seems hardly feasible.” (Ref. 3, p. 296).

H=p?/2m+U(q), the proof can be carried out immediately. The details
of this proof can be found in Ref. 73.

8 Heisenberg’s “classical” quantity x(n,t) is the classical solution x(t) of
Newton’s equation of motion subject to the old quantum condition
¢mxdx=nh. For example, given the purely classical position function
x(t)=a cos wt of a harmonic oscillator, the condition ¢mx?dt=nh quan-
tizes the amplitude, making a depend on n as follows: a(n)=\nh/ a7mw.
Thus, the motion of the harmonic oscillator in the stationary state n is
described by x(n,1)= \nh/ mw cos wt.

The introduction of transition components a(n,n—nel"-" into the
formalism was a milestone in the development of quantum theory. The
one-line abstract of Heisenberg’s paper reads “The present paper seeks to
establish a basis for theoretical quantum mechanics founded exclusively
upon relationships between quantities which in principle are observable”
(Ref. 3, p. 261). For Heisenberg, the observable quantities were a(n,n
—7) and w(n,n—7), that is, the amplitudes and the frequencies of the
spectral lines. Prior to 1925, little was known about transition amplitudes.
There was a sense that Einstein’s transition probabilities were related to
the squares of the transition amplitudes. Heisenberg made the transition
amplitudes (and frequencies) the central quantities of his theory. He dis-
covered how to manipulate them, relate them, and calculate their values.

SCIENTIFIC APTITUDE AND AUTISM

There’s even some evidence that scientific abilities are associated with traits characteristic of
autism, the psychological disorder whose symptoms include difficulties in social relationships and
communication, or its milder version, Asperger syndrome. One recent study, for instance, exam-
ined different groups according to the Autism-Spectrum Quotient test, which measures autistic
traits. Scientists scored higher than nonscientists on this test, and within the sciences, mathema-
ticians, physical scientists, and engineers scored higher than biomedical scientists.
