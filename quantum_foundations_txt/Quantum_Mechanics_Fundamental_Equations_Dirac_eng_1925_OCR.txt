The Fundamental Equations of Quantum Mechanics.

By P. A. M. Drrac, 1851 Exhibition Senior Research Student, St. John’s
College, Cambridge.

(Communicated by R. H. Fowler, F.R.S.—Received November 7th, 1925.)

§ 1. Introduction.

It is well known that the experimental facts of atomic physics necessitate
a departure from the classical theory of electrodynamics in the description of
atomic phenomena. This departure takes the form, in Bohr’s theory, of the
special assumptions of the existence of stationary states of an atom, in which it
does not radiate, and of certain rules, called quantum conditions, which fix
the stationary states and the frequencies of the radiation emitted during tran-
sitions between them. These assumptions are quite foreign to the classical
theory, but have been very successful in the interpretation of a restricted region
of atomic phenomena. The only way in which the classical theory is used is
through the assumption that the classical laws hold for the description of the
motion in the stationary states, although they fail completely during transitions,
and the assumption, called the Correspondence Principle, that the classical
theory gives the right results in the limiting case when the action per cycle of
the system is large compared to Planck’s constant h, and in certain other special
cases.

In a recent paper* Heisenberg puts forward a new theory, which suggests
that it is not the equations of classical mechanics that are in any way at fault,
but that the mathematical operations by which physical results are deduced
from them require modification. All the information supplied by the classical
theory can thus be made use of in the new theory.

§2. Quantum Algebra.

Consider a multiply periodic non-degenerate dynamical system of w degrees
of freedom, defined by equations connecting the co-ordinates and their time
differential coefficients. We may solve the problem on the classical theory in
the following way. Assume that each of the co-ordinates 2 can be expanded
in the form of a multiple Fourier series in the time ¢, thus,

B= Day anh (rhe «6+ Oy) EXP. 4 (1 + oe +... + ayy)
= Lx, exp. 1 (aw) t,

say, for brevity. Substitute these values in the equations of motion, and equate
the coefficients on either side of each harmonic term. The equations obtained
in this way (which we shall call the A equations) will determine each of the
amplitudes x, and frequencies (xw), (the frequencies being measured in radians
per unit time). The solution will not be unique. There will be a u-fold
infinity of solutions, which may be labelled by taking the amplitudes and
frequencies to be functions of uw constants x,... ty, Each #, and (aw) is
now a function of two sets of numbers, the «’s and the «’s, and may be written
Lany (KW).

In the quantum solution of the problem, according to Heisenberg, we still
assume that each co-ordinate can be represented by harmonic components
of the form exp. twé, the amplitude and frequency of each depending on two
sets of numbers n,... 7%, and m,...m,, in this case all integers, and being
written (nm), (nm). The differences n, — m, correspond to the previous
%,, but neither the n’s nor any functions of the n’s and m’s play the part of the
previous «’s in pointing out to which solution each particular harmonic
component belongs. We cannot, for instance, take together all the components
for which the n’s have a given set of values, and say that these by themselves
form a single complete solution of the equations of motion. The quantum
solutions are all interlocked, and must be considered as a single whole. The
effect of this mathematically is that, while on the classical theory each of the
A equations is a relation between amplitudes and frequencies having one
particular set of «’s, the amplitudes and frequencies occurring in a quantum
A equation do not have one particular set of values for the n’s, or for any
functions of the n’s and m’s, but have their n’s and m’s related in a special way,
which will appear later.

On the classical theory we have the obvious relation

(x0)« + (BO). = (% +B, Oe

Following Heisenberg, we assume that the corresponding relation on the
quantum theory is

@ (n,n — 4) + @(n — a, mM —a—B) = w(n, n— a — B)
or

@ (nm) -+ @ (mk) = w (nk). (1)

This means that w (nm) is of the form Q (n) — Q (m), the 0’s being frequency
levels. On Bohr’s theory these would be 27/h times the energy levels, but we
do not need to assume this.

On the classical theory we can multiply two harmonic components related to
the same set of «’s, as follows :—

Gag EXP. % (HOD), E. Dee EXP. 7 (BO). = (Ab) ate CXP-t(% + B, O)eb
where
(ab) a+.6,6 = FaxDpee
In a corresponding manner on the quantum theory we can multiply an (nm)
and an (mk) component

a (nm) exp. t@ (nm) t.b (mk) exp. iw (mk) t = ab (nk) exp. iw (nk) t
where ab (nk) = a (nm) b (mk).

We are thus led to consider the product of the amplitudes of an (nm) and
an (mk) component as an (vk) amplitude. This, together with the rule that
only amplitudes related to the same pair of sets of numbers can occur added
together in an A equation, replaces the classical rule that all amplitudes
occurring in an A equation have the same set of «’s.

We are now in a position to perform the ordinary algebraic operations on
quantum variables. The sum of and y is determined by the equations

{e+ y} (am) = a (nm) + y (nm)
and the product by
ay (nm). Ly, a(n) y (km) (2)
similar to the classical product
(ty) ax = DirYar, ws

An important difference now occurs between the two algebras. In general
ay (nm) = yx (nm)

and quantum multiplication is not commutative, although, as is easily verified,
it is associative and distributive. The quantity with components zy (nm)
defined by (2) we shall call the Heisenberg product of « and y, and shall write
simply as zy. Whenever two quantum quantities occur multiplied together,
the Heisenberg product will be understood. Ordinary multiplication is, of
course, implied in the products of amplitudes and frequencies and other
quantities that are related. to sets of n’s which are explicitly stated.

The reciprocal of a quantum quantity « may be defined by either of the

relations
Ifje.n=1 or w.lfo=l, (3)

These two equations are equivalent, since if we multiply both sides of the

former by « in front and divide by x behind we get the latter. In a similar
way the square root of « may be defined by

Ve .ra/u= o. (4)

It is not obvious that there always should be solutions to (3) and (4). In
particular, one may have to introduce sub-harmonics, 7.e., new intermediate
frequency levels, in order to express4/z. One may evade these difficulties by
rationalising and multiplying up each equation before interpreting it on the
quantum theory and obtaining the A equations from it.

We are now able to take over each of the equations of motion of the system
into the quantum theory provided we can decide the correct order of the
quantities in each of the products. Any equation deducible from the equations
of motion by algebraic processes not involving the interchange of the factors
of a product, and by differentiation and integration with respect to ¢, may
also be taken over into the quantum theory. In particular, the energy
equation may be thus taken over.

The equations of motion do not suffice to solve the quantum problem. On
the classical theory the equations of motion do not determine the x,, (2),
as functions of the «’s until we assume something about the «’s which serves
to define them. We could, if we liked, complete the solution by choosing
the «’s such that 0E/0«, = «,/2nx, where E is the energy of the system,
which would make the «, equal the action variables J,. There must be corre:
sponding equations on the quantum theory, and these constitute the quantum
conditions.

§3. Quantum Differentiation.

Up to the present the only differentiation that we have considered on the
quantum theory is that with respect to the time ¢. We shall now determine
the form of the most general quantum operation d/dv that satisfies the laws

@ gt yy =egt ft
dy OT N= et Ah ®
and
d d ad
DOG yt say. (II)

(Note that the order of « and y is preserved in the last equation.)
The first of these laws requires that the amplitudes of the components of
dx/dv shall be linear functions of those of a, 7.e.,

da|dv (nm) = Xam a (nm; n'm’) x (n'm’). (5)

There is one coefficient a (nm; n’m’) for any four sets of integral values for
the n’s, m’s, n”s and m'’s. The second law imposes conditions on the a’s.
Substitute for the differential coefficients in II their values according to (5)
and equate the (nm) components on either side. The result is

Lame &(nm 3 n'm’) x (n’k) y (kim’) = Xp a (nk 5 nk’) x (n'k’) y (km)
+ Zim & (nk) a (km; k'm’) y (k'm’).
This must be true for all values of the amplitudes of # and y, so that we can
equate the coefficients of a (n’k) y(k'm’) on either side. Using the symbol

Sn to have the value unity when m= (i.e., when each m, = m,) and zero
when m#n, we get

Say @ (nm 3 n'm’) = Simm @ (nk; n'k) + Says @ (km; k’m’).
To proceed further, we have to consider separately the various cases of equality
and inequality between the kk’, mm’ and nn’.
Take first the case when k =k’, mm’, nn’. This gives
a(nm; n'm’) = 0.

Hence all the a (nm; n'm’) vanish except those for which either » =n’ or
m= m’ (or both). The cases k 4k’, m=m', n#~n' andk#Ak', mAm,
n=n' do not give us anything new. Now take the case k= hk’, m= wm’,
n#n'. This gives

a (nm; n'm) = a(nk; n’k).

Hence a (nm ; n’m) is independent of m provided n # n’. Similarly, the case
k=k',m A m’,n =n’ tells us that a (nm; nm’) is independent of n provided
m#m'. The casek £k', m=m', n =n’ now gives
a(nk'; nk) +-a(km; k'm) = 0.
We can sum up these results by putting
a (nk! ; nk) = a (kk) == — a (km; k’m), (6)

provided k 4k’. The two-index symbol a (kk’) depends, of course, only on
the two sets of integers k and k’. The only remaining case is k = kh’, m =m’,
n =n’, which gives
a(nm; nm) = a (nk; nk) + a (km; km).
This means we can put
a (nm; nm) = a(mm) — a (nn). (7)

Equation (7) completes equation (6) by defining a (kk’) when k = kh’.

Equation (5) now reduces to

dx|dv (nm) = Xin ~ma (nm; nm’) « (nm) + Ly en a (nm; n'm) x (n'm)
-+ a{nm ; nm) x (nm)
= Za xm @ (m'm) x (nm) — Xn an a(n’) & (n'm)
+ {a (mm) — a (nn)}x (nm)
== Li, {x (nk) a (km) — a (nk) x (km)}.
Hence
dafdv = xa — az. (8)

Thus the most general operation satisfying the laws I and II that one can
perform upon a quantum variable is that of taking the difference of its Heisen-
berg products with some other quantum variable. It is easily seen that one
cannot in general change the order of differentiations, 7.¢.,

Px Px
dudv ” dvdu"

As an example in quantum differentiation we may take the case when (a)
is a constant, so that a (nm) == 0 except when n =m. We get

dx|dv (nm) = x (nm) a (mm) — a (nn) x (nm).

In particular, if 1a (mm) = Q (m), the frequency level previously introduced,
we have

dx|dv (nm) == tw (nm) x (nm),
and our differentiation with respect to v becomes ordinary differentiation with
respect to ¢.

§4. The Quantum Conditions.

We shall now consider to what the expression (zy — yx) corresponds on the
classical theory. To do this we suppose that 2 (2,Q—2) varies only slowly
with the n’s, the n’s being large numbers and the «’s small ones, so that we
can put

L(N, M— 0) = Cox
where «, = n,h or (n,-+ «,) h, these being practically equivalent. We now have
&(n, n—a) y (n—a, N—a—f) — y(n, n—B) a (n—B, n—a—B)
{a (n, n—a)—x (n—B, n—B—a)} y (n—a«, n—a—B)
{y (n,n —B)—y (n—a, n—a—B)} # (n—B, m—a—B).

Now

where the p’s and q’s are any set of canonical variables of the system.
The elementary Poisson bracket expressions for various combinations of

the p’s and q’s are
[4G] = 9, [pp pel = 0,

[ges Pal = Sy = 0 (#8) (10)

The general bracket expressions satisfy the laws I and II, which now read
(x, 2] + [yz] =[e+y, 2], Ia
(ay, z] = [#, z]y + &[y, 2]. Ila
By means of these laws, together with [#,y] = — [y, x], if # and y are

given as algebraic functions of the p, and q,, [x,y] can be expressed in terms
of the [q,, ds], [p» pe] and [q,,p,], and thus evaluated, without using the
commutative law of multiplication (except in so far as it is used implicitly on
account of the proof of Ila requiring it). The bracket expression [w, y] thus
has a meaning on the quantum theory when x and y are quantum variables,
if we take the elementary bracket expressions to be still given by (10).

We make the fundamental assumption that the difference between the Heisen-
berg products of two quantum quantities is equal to th/2m times their Poisson
bracket expression. In symbols,

ay — yx = th/In . [a, y]. (11)

We have seen that this is equivalent, in the limiting case of the classical
theory, to taking the arbitrary quantities x, that label a solution equal to
the J,, and it seems reasonable to take (11) as constituting the general quantum
conditions.

lt is not obvious that all the information supplied by equation (11) is con-
sistent. Owing to the fact that the quantities on either side of (11) satisfy
the same laws I and IT or Ia and Ia, the only independent conditions given by
(11) are those for which x and y are p’s or q’s, namely

TAs — 4r = 9 }

PDs — PsPp = 0 fae (12)
VPs — Pdr = Sis th [2 J

If the only grounds for believing that the equations (12) were consistent with
each other and with the equations of motion were that they are known to be
consistent in the limit when 4-> 0, the case would not be very strong, since
one might be able to deduce from them the inconsistency that h = 0, which
would not be an inconsistency in the limit. There is much stronger evidence
than this, however, owing to the fact that the classical operations obey the
same laws as the quantum ones, so that if, by applying the quantum operations,
one can get an inconsistency, by applying the classical operations in the same
way one must also get an inconsistency. If a series of classical operations
leads to the equation 0 = 0, the corresponding series of quantum operations
must also lead to the equation 0 = 0, and not to h = 0, since there is no way
of obtaining a quantity that does not vanish by a quantum operation with
quantum variables such that, the corresponding classical operation with the
corresponding classical variables gives a quantity that does vanish. The
possibility mentioned above of deducing by quantum operations the incon-
sistency h = 0 thus cannot occur. The correspondence between the quantum
and classical theories lies not so much in the limiting agreement when h->0 as
in the fact that the mathematical operations on the two theories obey in many cases
the same laws. :

For a system of one degree of freedom, if we take p = mq, the only quantum

condition is
2rm (9G — Gq) = th.

650 P. A. M. Dirac.

This is equivalent to Heisenberg’s quantum condition.* By equating the
remaining components of the left-hand side to zero we get further relations
not given by Heisenberg’s theory.

The quantum conditions (12) get over, in many cases, the difficulties concern-
ing the order in which quantities occurring in products in the equations of
motion are to be taken. The order does not matter except when a p, and q,
are multiplied together, and this never occurs in a system describable by a
potential energy function that depends only on the q’s, and a kinetic energy
function that depends only on the p’s.

It may be pointed out that the classical theory quantity occurring in Kramers’
and Heisenberg’s theory of scattering by atomst has components which are
of the form (8) (with «,=J,), and which are interpreted on the quantum
theory in a manner in agreement with the present theory. No classical expres-
sion involving differential coefficients can be interpreted on the quantum
theory unless it can be put into this form.

§5. Properties of the Quantum Poisson Bracket Expressions.
In this section we shall deduce certain results that are independent of the
assumption of the quantum conditions (11) or (12).
The Poisson bracket expressions satisfy on the classical theory the identity

(x, y, 2] = [le yk 2] + [ly 2] #] + [lz #] y] =0. (13)
On the quantum theory this result is obviously true when «, y and z are
p’s or gs. Also, from Ia and IIa

[y+ %a y, 2] =[%, y, zZ] + [%2, y, 2]

and
[®1, Vg, Y, 2] = © [Z, y, 2] + [%, Y, Z] Vp.

Hence the result must still be true on the quantum theory when 2, y and z

are expressible in any way as sums and products of p’s and q’s, so that it must
be generally true. Note that the identity corresponding to (13) when the
Poisson bracket expressions are replaced by the differences of the Heisenberg
products (ay — yx) is obviously true, so that there is no inconsistency with
equation (11).

If H is the Hamiltonian function of the system, the equations of motion
may be written classically :

Pr = [Pry H] Ge = [Gr HH].

Fundamental Equations of Quantum Mechanics. 651

These equations will be true on the quantum theory for systems for which
the orders of the factors of products occurring in the equations of motion are
unimportant. They may be taken to be true for systems for which these
orders are important if one can decide upon the orders of the factors in H.
From laws Ia and IIa it follows that

& = [#, H] (14)
on the quantum theory for any «.

If A is an integral of the equations of motion on the quantum theory,
then.
[A, H] =0.

The action variables J, must, of course, satisfy this condition. If A, and A,
are two such integrals, then, by a simple application of (13), it follows that

[A,, Ag] = const.
as on the classical theory.

The conditions on the classical theory that a set of variables P,, Q, shall be
canonical are

[Q, Q]=0  [P,, PJ] =9
[Qys Pl = Sree

These equations may be taken over into the quantum theory as the conditions
for the quantum variables P,, Q, to be canonical.

On the classical theory we can introduce the set of canonical variables
E,, 4, related to the uniformising variables J,, w,, by

€, = (2x)? Ip exp. 2niw, yy = — 1 Qn) exp. — 2niw,.

Presumably there will be a corresponding set of canonical variables on the
quantum theory, each containing only one kind of component, so that
2, (nm) =0 except when m,=n,— 1 and m, =n, (s #7), and yy (nm) = 0
except when m,=m,+1 and m,=n,(s #7). One may consider the
existence of such variables as the condition for the system to be multiply periodic
on the quantum theory. The components of the Heisenberg products of
&, and », satisfy the relation

En, (nn) = &, (nm) np (mn) = hy (mn) &, (mm) = npb, (mm) (15)

where the m’s are related to the ”’s by the formule m, = n,—1, m, = 7, (8 #1).
The classical &’s and 7’s satisfy n= — 7/2x.J,. This relation does not
necessarily hold between the quantum &’s and y’s. The quantum relation

may, for instance, be 1,€,= —7/2r.J,, or 4 (Ene mb,) = — t/2n. J,
A detailed investigation of any particular dynamical system is necessary in
order to decide what it is. In the event of the last relation being true, we
can introduce the set of canonical variables ¢,’, n,’ defined by

Eyl = (Ent tne) 2, ae = (Ue tt) V2
and shall then have
Span 2+ ay).
This is the case that actually occurs for the harmonic oscillator. In general
J, is not necessarily even a rational function of the &, and y,, an example
of this being the rigid rotator considered by Heisenberg.

§6. The Stationary States.

A quantity C, that does not vary with the time, has all its (nm) components
zero, except those for which x =m. It thus becomes convenient to suppose
each set of n’s to be associated with a definite state of the atom, as on Bohr’s
theory, so that each C (nn) belongs to a certain state in precisely the same way
in which every quantity occurring in the classical theory belongs to a certain
configuration. The components of a varying quantum quantity are so inter-
locked, however, that it is impossible to associate the sum of certain of them with
a given state.

A relation between quantum quantities reduces, when all the quantities are
constants, to a relation between C(nm)’s belonging to a definite stationary state n.
This relation will be the same as the classical theory relation, on the assumption
that the classical laws hold for the description of the stationary states ; in
particular, the energy will be the same function of the J’s as on the classical

theory. We have here a justification for Bohr’s assumption of the mechanical
nature of the stationary states. It should be noted though, that the variable
quantities associated with a stationary state on Bohr’s theory, the amplitudes
and frequencies of orbital motion, have no physical meaning and are of no
mathematical importance.

If we apply the fundamental equation (11) to the quantities « and H we get,
with the help of (14),

a (nm) H (mm) — H (nn) « (nm) = th/2n . & (nm) = — h/2x . w (nm) x (nm),
or H (nn) — H (mm) = h/2n . w (nm).

This is just Bohr’s relation connecting the frequencies with the energy
differences.

The quantum condition (11) applied to the previously introduced canonical
variables &,, jp gives
Eqn (nm) — heb, (nm) == th [27 . [Ep No] = th/2re.
This equation combined with (15) shows that
E,ny» (nn) = — 1, th/27m + const.

It is known physically that an atom has a normal state in which it does not
radiate. This is taken account of in the theory by Heisenberg’s assumption
that all the amplitudes C (mm) having a negative n, or m, vanish, or rather do
not exist, if we take the normal state to be the one for which every n, is zero.
This makes &,n, (nn) = 0 when n, = 0 on account of equation (15). Hence in
general

Ejty (tin) = — n, sh] Ire.

If Eq, = — 1/20. J,, then J, = 2,h. This is just the ordinary rule for quan-
tising the stationary states, so that in this case the frequencies of the system
are the same as those given by Bohr’s theory. If 4 (En, + 8) = — /2n.J,,
then J, = (n,-+4)h. Hence in general in this case, half quantum numbers
would have to be used to give the correct frequencies by Bohr’s theory.*

Up to the present we have considered only multiply periodic systems. There
does not seem to be any reason, however, why the fundamental equations (11)
and (12) should not apply as well to non-periodic systems, of which none of
the constituent particles go off to infinity, such as a general atom. One would
not expect the stationary states of such a system to classify, except perhaps
when there are pronounced periodic motions, and so one would have to assign
a single number n to each stationary state according to an arbitrary plan. Our
quantum variables would still have harmonic components, each related to
two n’s, and Heisenberg multiplication could be carried out exactly as before,
There would thus be no ambiguity in the interpretation of equations (12) or
of the equations of motion.

I would like to express my thanks to Mr. R. H. Fowler, F.R.S., for many
valuable suggestions in the writing of this paper.

* In the special case of the Planck oscillator, since the energy is a linear function of J,
the frequency would come right in any case.
