3. The temperature coefficient was small: 1.06—1.11 for 10°.

4. The velocity of the pinacone formation is greatly dependent on
the alcohol; for instance, the methy! aleohol and the allyl
aleohol were oxidiséd much more slowly than other primary
and secondary alcohols.

5. The velocity of the pinacone formation is. greatly dependent
on the ketone, ihe benzophenone is attacked rapidly, most of
the ketones as yet examined less rapidly, many not at all.

6. The ratio of these velocities in different. aleohols ‘is constant.

7. . The active light of the ketone reduction is sure to be situated
in the spectrum between 400 and 430 up and very probably
in, or adjacent to, the rays 404. 7 and 407.8 of the mercary
quartz lamp.

8. The ratio of the velocities of the pinacone formation in sun-
light and in mercury light is the same.

9. When two ketones are present simultaneously one of them
absorbs a part of the rays required by the other ketone; this
also appears when the light passes through a solution of the
one ketone and falls on that of the other.

Particularly in the case of the powerfully absorbing ketones’

the hindrances are stronger than was to be expected.

APPENDIX.

The contrast between Pusncr’s hypothesis of the energy-grades and
Einstein’s hypothesis of energy-quanta.

The permutation of ihe elements « is a purely formal device, just as the per-
mutation of the elements 0 is. More than once the analogous, equally formal device
used by PLANCK, viz. distribution of P energy-elements over N resonators, has by
a misunderstanding been given a physical interpretation, which is absolutely in
conflict with PLanck’s radiation-formula and would lead to Wien’s radiation formula.

As a matter of fact PLancx’s energy-elements were in that case almost entirely
identified with Etnsret's light-qnanta and accordingly it was said, that the difference
between PLANCK and ErnsTein consists herein that the latter assumes the existence
of mutually independent energy-quanta also in empty space, the former only in
the interior of matter, in the resonators. The confusion which underlies this view
has been more than once pointed out *). Erysrein really considers P similar quanta,
existing independently of each other. He discusses for instance the case, that they
distribute themselves irreversibly from a space of NV, cm’ over a larger space of
WV, cm’ and he finds using Bourzman’s entropy-formula: S = klog W, that this
produces a gain of entropy 5):

1) It may be added, that the problem of the distribution of N resonators over
the energy-grades corresponds to the following: On a rod, whose length is a mul-
tiple Ps of a given length -, notches have been cut, at distances ¢, 2e, etc. from
one of the ends. At each of the notches, and only there, the rod may be broken,
the separate pieces may subsequently be joined together in arbitrary numbers and
in arbitrary order, the rods thus obtained not being distinguishable from each other
otherwise than by a possible difference in length. The question is, in how many
different manners (comp. Appendix) the rod may be divided and the pieces distri-
buted over a given number of boxes, to be distinguished from each other as the
ist 2nd,.... Nth, when no box may contain more than one red. If the boxes,

which may be thought of as rectangular, are placed side by side in one line, they .

form together as.it were an oblong drawer with (N—1) partitions, formed of two
walls each, (comp. the above symbol in ils first form, from which the second
form was derived by abstracting from the fact, that each mulliple.of « forms one

«whole each time), and these double partitions may be imagined to be mutually

exchanged, the boxes themselves remaining where they are. The possibility of this
exchange is indicated by the form of the symbol chosen.

As a further example corresponding to the symbol we may take a thread on
which between P beads of the same kind, (N—J) beads of a different kind are
strung, which divide. the beads of the first kind in a Ist, 2nd... Nth group.
