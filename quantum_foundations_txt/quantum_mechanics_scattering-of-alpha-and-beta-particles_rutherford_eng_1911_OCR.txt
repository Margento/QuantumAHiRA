LXXIX. The Scattering of a and B Particles by Matter and
the Structure of the Atom. By Professor E. Ruruerrorp,
F.RS., University of Manchester *.

§1. TC is well known that the a and @ particles suffer
deflexions from their rectilinear paths by encounters

with atoms of matter. This scattering is far more marked
for the @ than for the a particle on account of the much
smaller momentum and energy of the former particle.
There seems to be no doubt that such swiftly moving par-
ticles pass through the atoms in their path, and that the
deflexions observed are due to the strong electric field
traversed within the atomic system. It has generally been
supposed that the scattering of a pencil of a or @ rays in
passing through a thin plate of matter is the result of a
multitude of small scatterings by the atoms of matter
traversed. The observations, however, of Geiger and
Marsden f on the scattering of a rays indicate that some of
the @ particles must suffer a deflexion of more than a right
angle at a single encounter. They found, for example, that
asmall fraction of the incident @ particles, about 1 in 20,000,
were turned through an average angle of 90° in passing
through a layer of gold-foil about 00004 em. thick, which
was equivalent in stopping-power of the a particle to 1°6 milli-
metres of air. Geiger t showed later that the most probable
angle of deflexion for a pencil of « particles traversing a gold-
foil of this thickness was about 0°87. A simple calcnlation
based on the theory of probability shows that the chance of
an @ particle being deflected through 90° is vanishingly
small. In addition, it will be seen later that the distribution
of the « particles for various angles of iarge deflexion does
not follow the probability law to be expected if such large
deflexions are made up of a large number of small deviations.
It seems reasonable to suppose that the deflexion through
a large angle is due to a single atomic encounter, for the
chance of a second encounter of a kind to produce a large
deflexion must in most cases be exceedingly small. A simple
calculation shows that the atom must be a seat of an intense
electric field in order to produce such a large deflexion ata
single encounter.

Recently Sir J. J. Thomson § has put forward a theory to

explain the scattering of electrified particles in passing through
small thicknesses of matter. The atom is supposed to consist
of a number N of negatively charged corpuscles, accompanied
by an equal quantity of positive electricity uniformly dis-
tributed throughout a sphere. The deflexion of a negatively
electrified particle in passing through the atom is ascribed to
two causes—(1) the repulsion of the corpuscles distributed
through the atom, and (2) the attraction of the positive
electricity in the atom. The deflexion of the particle in
passing through the atom is supposed to be small, while
the average deflexion after a large number m of encounters
was taken as 1/m.0, where @ is the average deflexion due
toa single atom. It was shown that the number N of the
electrons within the atom could be deduced from observations
of the scattering of electrified particles. The accuracy of this
theory of compound scattering was examined experimentally
by Crowther* in a later paper. His results apparently
confirmed the main conclusions of the theory, and ke deduced,
on the assumption that the positive electricity was coniinuous,
that the number of electrons in an atom was about three
times its atomic weight.

The theory of Sir J. J. Thomson is based on the assumption
that the scattering due to a single atomic encounter is small,
and the particular structure assumed for the atom does not
admit of a very large deflexion of an @ particle in traversing
a single atom, unless it be supposed that the diameter of the
sphere of positive electricity is minute compared with the
diameter of the sphere of influence of the atom.

Since the a and 8 particles traverse the atom, it should be
possible from a close study of the nature of the deflexion to
form some idea of the constitution of the atom to produce
the effects observed. In fact, the scattering of high-speed
charged particles by the atoms of matter is one of the most
promising metliods of attack of this problem. The develop-
ment of the scintillation method of counting single « particles
affords unusual advantages of investigation, and the researches
of H. Geiger by this method have already added much to
our knowledge of the scattering of a rays by matter.

§ 2. We shall first examine theoretically the single en-
counters ¢ with an atom of simple structure, which is able to

an encounter with a single atom will in this paper be called “ single”
scattering. The deviation of a particle resulting from a multitude of
small deviations will be termed “compound ” scattering.

produce large deflexions of an « particle, and then compare
the deductions from the theory with the experimental data
available.

Consider an atom which contains a charge «Ne at its
centre surrounded by a sphere of electrification coutaining
a charge Ne supposed uniformly distributed throughout a
sphere of radius R. e is the fundamental unit of charge,
which in this paper is taken as 4°65x 10-" Es. unit. We
shall suppose that for distances less than 10-!? cm. the central
charge and also the charge on the a particle may be sup-
posed to be concentrated at a point. It will be shown that
the main deductions from the theory are independent of
whether the central charge is supposed to be positive or
negative. Jor convenience, the sign will be assumed to be
positive. The question of the stability of the atom proposed
need not be considered at this stage, for this will obviously
depend upon the minute structure of the atom, and on the
motion of the constituent charged parts,

In order to form some idea of the forces required to
deflect an « particle through a large angle, consider an atom
containing a positive charge Ne at its centre, and surrounded
by a distribution of negative electricity Ne uniformly dis-
tributed within a sphere of radius R. The electric force X
and the potential V at a distance r from the centre of an
atom for a point inside the atom, are given by

=
V=Ne(; ~ in + on

Suppose an « particle of mass m and velocity u and charge B
shot directly towards the centre of the atom. It will be
brought to rest at a distance 6 from the centre given by

1 38 B
dmv =NeE (; — oR + am)

Jé will be seen that 4 is an important quantity in later
calculations. Assuming that the central charge is 100¢, it
can be calculated that the value of 6 for an @ particle of
velocity 2°09 x 10° cms. per second is about 3:4 x 10-” em,
In this calculation 6 is supposed to be very small compared
with R. Since R is supposed to be of the order of the
radius of the atom, viz. 10-® em., it is obvious that the
a particle before being turned back penetrates so close to

the central charge, that the field due to the uniform dis-
tribution of negative electricity may be neglected. In
general, a simple calculation shows that for all deflexions
greater than a degree, we may without sensible error suppose
the deflexion due to the field of the central charge alone.
Possible single deviations due to the negative electricity, if
distributed in the form of corpuscles, are not taken into
account at this stage of the theory. It will be shown later
that its effect is in general small compared with that due to
the central field.

Consider the passage of a positive electrified particle close
to the centre of an atom. Supposing that the velocity of
the particle is not appreciably changed by its passage through
the atom, the path of the particle under the influence of a
repulsive force varying inversely as the square of the distance
will be an hyperbola with the centre of the atom S as the
external focus. Suppose the particle to enter the atom in
the direction PO (fig. 1), and that the direction of motion

of the few particles which are scattered through a large

the number of collisions of the particle with the atom of
radius R is wR?nt in the thickness ¢.

forces are attractive instead of repulsive.

(2) thickness of scattering material ¢ provided this is

(3) magnitude of central charge Ne ;

(4) and is inversely proportional to (mu*)?, or to the
fourth power of the velocity if m be constant.

Tn these calculations, it is assumed that the « particles
scittered through a large angle suffer only one large deflexion.
For this to hold, it is essential that the thickness of the
scattering material should be so small that the chance of
a second encounter involving another large deflexion is very
small. If, for example, the probability of a single deflexion
@ in passing through a thickness ¢ is 1/1000, the probability
of two successive deflexions each of value ¢ is 1/10°, and
is negligibly small.

The angular distribution of the « particles scattered from
a thin metal sheet affords one of the simplest methods of
testing the general correctness of this theory of single
scattering. This has been done recently for a rays by
Dr. Geiger *, who found that the distribution for particles
deflected between 30° and 150° from a thin gold-foil was in
substantial agreement with the theory. A more detailed
account of these and other experiments to test the validity
of the theory will be published later.

§ 4. Alteration of velocity in an atomic encounter.

It has so far been assumed that an « or 8 particle does not
suffer an appreciable change of velocity as the result of a
single atomic encounter resulting in a large deflexion of the
particle. The effect of such an encounter in altering the
velocity of the particle can be calculated on certain assump-
tions. It is supposed that only two systems are involved,
viz., the swiftly moving particle and the atom which it
traverses supposed initially at rest. It is supposed that the
principle of conservation of momentum and of energy
applies, and that there is no appreciable loss of energy or
momentum by radiation.

deviation of 90° in traversing an aluminium atom. This is
of a magnitude to be easily detected experimentally. Since
the value of K is very large for an encounter of a @ particle
with an atom, the reduction of velocity on this formula is
very small,

Some very interesting cases of the theory arise in con-
sidering the changes of velocity and the distribution of
scattered particles when the @ particle encounters a light
atom, for example a hydrogen or helium atom, A discussion
of these and similar cases is reserved until the question has
been examined experimentally,

§ 5. Comparison of single and compound scattering.

Before comparing the results of theory with experiment, it
is desirable to consider the relative importance of single and
compound scattering in determining the distribution of the
seattered particles, Since the atom is supposed to consist of
a central charge surrounded by a uniform distribution of the
opposite sign through a sphere of radius R, the chance of
encounters with the atom involving small deflexions is very
great compared with the chance of a single large deflexion.

This question of compound scattering has been examined
by Sir J. J. Thomson in the paper previously discussed (§ 1).
In the notation of this paper, the average deflexion ¢, due to
the field of the sphere of positive electricity of radius R and
quantity Ne was found by him to be

$=" Neo 1

The average deflexion ¢, due to the N negative corpuscles
supposed distributed uniformly throughout the sphere was
found to be

The mean deflexion due to both positive and negative electricity
was taken as

(2-+¢2)".

Ina similar way, it is not difficult to calculate the average
deflexion due to the atom with a central charge discussed in
this paper.

Since the radial electric field X at any distance r from the

r=H-B)"

where p is the perpendicular from the centre on the path of
the particle and 6 has the same value as before. It is seen
that the value of @ increases with diminution of p and becomes
great for small values of ¢.

Since we have already seen that the deflexions become
very large for a particle passing near the centre of the atom,
it is obviously not correct to find the average value by
assuming @ is small.

Taking R of the order 10-%cm., the value of p for a large
deflexion is for a and @ particles of the order 10-4 cm.
Since the chance of an encounter involving a large defiexion
is small compared with the chance of small deflexions, a
simple consideration shows that the average small deflexion
is practically unaltered if the large deflexions are omitted.
This is equivalent to integrating over that part of the cross
section of the atom where the deflexions are small and
neglecting the small central area. It can in this way be
simply shown that the average small deflexion is given by

3m bh
= ER

This value of ¢, for the atom with a concentrated central

charge is three times the magnitude of the average deflexion

for the same value of Ne in the type of atom examined by

Sir J. J. Thomson. Combining the deflexions due to the
electric field and to the corpuscles, the average deflexion is

b BA \ve

(b2+¢22)? or a 554+ **) .

It will be seen later that the value of N is nearly proportional
to the atomic weight, and is about 100 for gold. tthe effect
due to scattering of the individual corpuscles expressed by
the second term of the equation is consequently small for
heavy atoms compared with that due to the distributed
electric field.

Neglecting the second term, the average deflexion per

atom is BR: We are now in a position to consider the
relative effects on the distribution of particles due to single
and to compound seattering. Following J. J. Thomson’s
argument, the average deflexion 6, after passing through a
thickness ¢ of matter is proportional to the square root of the
number of encounters and is given by

¢ is sufficiently small that

Jt is evident from this comparison, that the probability for
any given deflexion is always greater for single than for
compound scattering, The difference is especially marked
when only a small fraction of the particles are scattered
through any given angle. It follows from this result that
the distribution of particles due to encounters with the atoms
js for small thicknesses mainly governed by single scattering.
No doubt compound scattering produces some effect in
equalizing the distribution of the scattered particles ; but its
effect. becomes relatively smaller, the smaller the fraction
of the particles seattered through a given angle.

§6. Comparison of Theory with Experiments.

On the present theory, the value of the central charge Ne
is an important constant, and it is desirable to determine its
value for different atoms. This can be most simply done by
determining the small fraction of a or @ particles of known
velocity falling ona thin metal screen, which are scattered
between ¢ and ¢+d¢ where ¢ is the angle of deflexion.
The influence of compound scattering should be small when
this fraction is small.

Experiments in these directions are in progress, but it is
desirable at this stage to discuss in the light of the present
theory the data already published on scattering of @ and B
particles.

The following points will be discussed :—

(a) The “diffuse reflexion” of @ particles, i.e. the
scattering of « particles through large angles (Geiger
and Marsden).

(b) The variation of diffuse reflexion with atomic weight
of the radiator (Geiger and Marsden).

(c) The average scattering of a pencil of « rays trans-
mitted through a thin metal plate (Geiger).

(d) The experiments of Crowther on the scattering of
8 rays of different velocities by various metals.

(a) In the paper of Geiger and Marsden (loc. cit.) on the
diffuse reflexion of « particles falling on various substances
it was shown that about 1/8000 of the a particles from radium
C falling on a thick plate of platinum are scattered back in
the direction of the incidence, This fraction is deduced on
the assumption that the a particles are uniformly scattered
in all directions, the observations being made for a deflexion
of about 90°. The form of experiment is not very suited for
accurate calculation, but from the data available it can be
shown that the scattering observed is about that to be expected
on the theory if the atom of platinum has a central charge of
about 100 e.

(b) In their experiments on this subject, Geiger and
Marsden gave the relative number of @ particles diffusely
reflected from thick layers of different metals, under similar
conditions. The numbers obtained by them are given in the
table below, where z represents the relative number of
scattered particles, measured by the number of scintillations
per minute on a zine sulphide sereen.

On the theory of single scattering, the fraction of the total
number of # particles scattered through any given angle in
passing through a thickness ¢ is proportional to n.A%,
assuming that the central charge is proportional to the atomic
weight A. In the present case, the thickness of matter from
which the scattered « particles are able to emerge and affect
the zinc sulphide screen depends on the metal. Since Bragg
has shown that the stopping power of an atom for an a
particle is proportional to the square root of its atomic weight,
the value of nt for different elements is proportional-to 1/ //A.
In this case ¢ represents the greatest depth from which the
scattered a particles emerge. The number z of « particles
scattered back from a thick layer is consequently proportional
to A*? or z/A*? should be a constant.

To compare this deduction with experiment, the relative
values of the latter quotient are given in the last column.
Considering the difficulty of the experiments, the agreement
between theory and experiment is reasonably good *.

The single large scattering of particles will obviously
affect to some extent the shape of the Bragg ionization curve
for a pencil of a rays. This effect of large scattering should
be marked when the a rays have traversed screens of metals
of high atomic weight, but should be small for atoms of light
atomic weight.

(c) Geiger made a careful determination of the scattering
of « particles passing through thin metal foils, by the
scintillation method, and deduced the most probable anglo

through which the « particles are deflected in passing through
known thicknesses of different kinds of matter.

A narrow pencil of homogeneous @ rays was used as a
source. After passing through the scattering foil, the total
number of a particles deflected through different angles
was directly measured. The angle for which the number of
scattered particles was a maximum was taken as the most
probable angle. The variation of the most probable angle
with thickness of matter was determined, but calculation from
these data is somewhat complicated by the variation of
velocity of the « particles in their passage through the
scattering material. A consideration of the curve of distribu-
tion of the « particles given in the paper (loc. cit. p. 496) shows
that the angle through which half the particles are scattered
is about 20 per cent greater than the most probable angle.

We have already seen that compound scattering may
become important when abovt half the particles are scattered
through a given angle, and it is difficult to disentangle in
such cases the relative effects due to the two kinds of
scattering. An approximate estimate can be made in the
following way :— From (§ 5) the relation between the
probabilities p, and p, for compound and single scattering
respectively is given by

prlog p= —'721.
The probability g of the combined effects may as a first
approximation be taken as

q=(pi+pe)”.
If q='5, it follows that

Taking the probability of single scattering ='46 and
substituting the above values in the formula, the value of N
for gold comes out to be 97.

For a thickness of gold equivalent in stopping power to
2°12 cms. of air, Geiger found the most probable angle to be
3°40’, In this case t=-00047, 6=4°4, and average u=
1:7 x 10°, and N comes out to be 114.

Geiger showed that the most probable angle of deflexion
for an atom was nearly proportional to its atomic weight. It
consequently follows that the value of N for different atoms
should be nearly proportional to their atomic weights, at any
rate for atomic weights between gold and aluminium.

Since the atomic weight of platinum is nearly equal to that
of gold, it follows from these considerations that the
magnitude of the diffuse reflexion of « particles through more
than 90° from gold and the magnitude of the average small
angle scattering of a pencil of rays in passing through gold-
foil are both explained on the hypothesis of single scattering
by supposing the atom of gold has a central charge of about
100 e.

(d) Experiments of Crowther on scattering of B rays—
We shall now consider how far the experimental results of
Crowther on scattering of 8 particles of different velocities
by various materials can be explained on the general theory
of single scattering. On this theory, the fraction of 8
particles p turned through an angle greater than ¢ is
given by

p= Tn tH cot? p/2.

In most of Crowther’s experiments ¢ is sufficiently small
that tan p/2 may be put equal to ¢/2 without much error.
Consequently

P=2rn.t.P if p=1/2.

Ou the theory of compound scattering, we have already
seen that the chance p, that the deflexion of the particles
is greater than ¢ is given by

scaitering are thus identical in general form, but differ by a
numerical constant. It is thus clear that the main relations
on the theory of compound scattering of Sir J. J. Thomson,
which were verified experimentally by Crowther, hold equally
well on the theory of single scattering.

For example, if t, be the thickness for which half the
particles are scattered through an angle }, Crowther showed

2

that ¢/ 7tm and also i Vtm were constants for a given
inaterial when ¢ was fixed. These relations hold also on the
theory of single scattering. Notwithstanding this apparent
similarity in form, the two theories are fundamentally
different. In one ease, the effects observed are due to
cumulative effects of small deflexions, while in the other
the large deflexions are supposed to result from a single
encounter. The distribution of scattered particles is entirely
different on the two theories when the probability of deflexion
greater than ¢ is small.

‘We havo already seen that the distribution of scattered
a particles at various angles has been found by Geiger to be
in substantial agreement with the theory of single scattering,
but cannot be explained on the theory of compound scat-
tering alone. Since there is every reason to believe that
the laws of scattering of a and @ particles are very similar,
the law of distribution of scattered @ particles should be the
same as for a particles for small thicknesses of matter.
Since the value of mu?/B for the 6 particles is in most cases
much smaller than the corresponding value for the # par-
ticles, the chance of large single deflexions for 8 particles in
passing through a given thickness of matter is much greater
than for & particles. Since on the theory of single scatterin
the fraction of the number of particles which are deflected
through a given angle is proportional to kt, where ¢ is the
thickness supposed small and & a constant, the number of
particles which are undeflected through this angle is propor-
tional to 1~At. From considerations based on the theory of
compound scattering, Sir J. J. Thomson deduced that the
probability of deflexion less than ¢ is proportional to 1—e-#/
where pw is a constant for any given value of .

The correctness of this latter formula was tested by Crowther
by measuring electrically the fraction I/Iy of the scattered
B particles which passed through a circular opening sub-
tending an angle of 36° with the scattering material. If

I/Ip=1—e-*",

the value of I should decrease very slowly at first with

increase of ¢. Crowther, using aluminium as scattering
material, states that the variation of I/Iy was in good accord
with this theory for small values of ¢. On the other hand,
if single scattering be present, as 1b undoubtedly is for a rays,
the curve showing the relation between I/I, and ¢ should be
nearly linear in the initial stages. The experiments of
Madsen * on scattering of @ rays, although not made with
quite so small a thickness of aluminium as that used by
Crowther, certainly support such a conclusion. Considering
the importance of the point at issue, further experiments on
this question are desirable.

From the table given by Crowther of the value ¢/ “tm for
different elements for 8 rays of velocity 2°68 x 10 cms.
per second, the values of the central charge Ne can be
calculated on the theory of single scattering. a is supposed,
as in the case of the @ rays, that for the given value of
$/ “tm the fraction of the @ particles deflected by single
scattering through an angle greater than ¢ is ‘46 instead
of °5.

The values of N calculated from Crowther’s data are
given below.

It will be remembered that the values of N for gold
deduced from scattering of the # rays were in two calcula-
tions 97 and 114. These numbers are somewhat smaller
than the values given above for platinum (viz. 138), whose
atomic weight is not very different from gold. Taking into
account the uncertainties involved in the calculation from
the experimental data, the agreement is sufficiently close to
indicate that the same general laws of scattering hold for the
a and @ particles, notwithstanding the wide differences in
the relative velocity and mass of these particles.

As in the case of the « rays, the value of N should be
most simply determined for any given element by measuring

the small fraction of the incident 8 particles scattered through
a large angle. In this way, possible errors due to small
scattering will be avoided.

The scattering data for the @ rays, as well as for the
a rays, indicate that the central charge in an atom is
approximately proportional to its atomic weight. This falls
in with the experimental deductions of Schmidt*. In his
theory of absorption of 8 rays, he supposed that in traversing
a thin sheet of matter, a small fraction a of the particles are
stopped, and a small fraction 8 are reflected or scattered
back in the direction of incidence. From comparison of the
absorption curves of different elements, he deduced that
the value of the constant @ for different elements is propor-
tional to nA? where z is the number of atoms per unit volume
and A the atomic weight of the element. This is exactly the
relation to be expected on the theory of single scattering if
the central charge on an atom is proportional to its atomic
weight.

§ 7. General Considerations.

In comparing the theory outlined in this paper with the
experimental results, it has been supposed that the atom
consists of a central charge supposed concentrated at a point,
and that the large single deflexions of the « and 8 particles
are mainly due to their passage through the strong central
field. The effect of the equal and opposite compensating
charge supposed distributed uniformly throughout a sphere
has been neglected. Some of the evidence in support of
these assumptions will now be briefly considered. For con-
creteness, consider the passage of a high speed @ particle
through an atom having a positive central charge Ne, and
surrounded by a compensating charge of N electrons.
Remembering that the mass, momentum, and kinetic energy
of the # particle are very large compared with the corre-
sponding values for an electron in rapid motion, it does not
seem possible from dynamic considerations that an @ particle
can be deflected through a large angle by a close approach
to an electron, even if the latter be in rapid motion and
constrained by strong electrical forces. It seems reasonable
to suppose that the chance of single deflexions through a
large angle due to this cause, if not zero, must be exceedingly
small compared with that due to the central charge.

It is of interest to examine how far the experimental
evidence throws light on the question of the extent of the

Scattering of « and 8 Particles by Matter. 687

distribution of the central charge. Suppose, for example,
the central charge to be composed of N unit charges dis-
tributed over such a volume that the large single deflexions
are mainly due to the constituent charges and not to the
external field produced by the distribution. It has been
shown (§ 3) that the fraction of the « particles scattered
through a large angle is proportional to (NeE)?, where Ne is
the central charge concentrated at a point and E the charge
on the deflected particle. If, however, this charge is dis-
tributed in single units, the fraction of the a particles
scattered through a given angle is proportional to Ne? instead
of N’e, In this calculation, the influence of mass of the
constituent particle hus been neglected, and account has only
been taken of its electric field. Since it has been shown that
the value of the central point charge for gold must be about
100, the value of the distributed charge required to produce
the same proportion of single deflexions through a large
angle should be at least 10,000. Under these conditions the
mass of the constituent particle would be small compared
with that of the @ particle, and the difficulty arises of the
production of large single deflexions at all. In addition,
with such a large distributed charge, the effect of compound
scattering is relatively more important than that of single
scattering. For example, the probable small angle of de-
flexion of a pencil of « particles passing through a thin gold
foil would be much greater than that experimentally observed
by Geiger (§ 6-c). The large and small angle scattering
could not then be explained by the assumption of a central
charge of the same value. Considering the evidence as a
whole, it seems simplest to suppose that the atom contains
a central charge distributed through a very small volume,
and that the large single deflexions are due to the central
charge as a whole, and not to its constituents, At the same
time, the experimental evidence is not precise enough to
negative the possibility that a small fraction of the positive
charge may be carried by satellites extending some distance
from the centre. Evidence on this point could be obtained
by examining whether the same central charge is required
to explain the large single deflexions of « and 8 particles ;
for the # particle must approach much closer to the centre
of the atom than the @ particle of average speed to suffer
the same large deflexion.

The general data available indicate that the value of this
central charge for different atoms is approximately propor-
tional to their atomic weights, at any rate for atoms heavier
than aluminium. It will be of great interest to examine

experimentally whether such a simple relation holds also for
the lighter atoms. In cases where the mass of the deflecting
atom (for example, hydrogen, helium, lithium) is not very
different from that of the « particle, the general theory of
single scattering will require modification, for it is necessary
to take into account the movements of the atom itself
(see § 4).

It is of interest to note that Nagaoka * has mathematically
considered the properties of a ‘‘ Saturnian” atom which he
supposed to consist of a central attracting mass surrounded
by rings of rotating electrons. He showed that such a
system was stable if the attractive force was large. From
the point of view considered in this paper, the chance of
large deflexion would practically be unaltered, whether the
atom is considered to be a disk or a sphere. It may be
remarked that the approximate value found for the central
charge of the atom of gold (100e) is about that to be
expected if the atom of gold consisted of 49 atoms of helium,
each carrying a charge 2e. This may be only a coincidence,
but it is certainly suggestive in view of the expulsion of
helium atoms carrying two unit charges from radioactive
matter,

The deductions from the theory so far considered are
independent of the sign of the central charge, and it has not
so far been found possible to obtain definite evidence to
determine whether it be positive or negative. It may be
possible to settle the question of sign by consideration of the
difference of the laws of absorption of the 8 particle to be
expected on the two hypotheses, for the effect of radiation in
reducing the velocity of the @ particle should be far more
marked with a positive than with a negative centre. If the
central charge be positive, it is easily seen that a positively
charged mass if released from the centre of a heavy atom,
would acquire a great velocity in moving through the electric
field. It may be possible in this way to account for the high
velocity of expulsion of « particles without supposing that
they are initially in rapid motion within the atom.

Farther consideration of the application of this theory to
these and other questions will be reserved for a later paper,
when the main deductions of the theory have been tested
experimentally. JExperiments in this direction are already
in progress by Geiger and Marsden.
