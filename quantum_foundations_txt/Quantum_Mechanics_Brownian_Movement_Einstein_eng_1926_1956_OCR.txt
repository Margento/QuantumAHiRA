INVESTIGATIONS ON THE THEORY
OF THE BROWNIAN MOVEMENT

I

ON THE MOVEMENT OF SMALL PARTICLES
SUSPENDED IN A STATIONARY LIQUID
DEMANDED BY THE MOLECULAR-
KINETIC THEORY OF HEAT

N this paper it will be shown that according
I: the molecular-kinetic theory of heat, bodies
of microscopically-visible size suspended in a
liquid will perform movements of such magnitude
that they can be easily observed in a microscope,
on account of the molecular motions of heat.
It is possible that the movements to be discussed
here are identical with the so-called ‘‘ Brownian
molecular motion’? ; however, the information
available to me regarding the latter is so lacking
in precision, that I can form no judgment in the
matter (z).

If the movement discussed here can actually
be observed (together with the laws relating to

--- Page 3 ---
2 THEORY OF BROWNIAN MOVEMENT

it that one would expect to find), then classical
thermodynamics can no longer be looked upon
as applicable with precision to bodies even of
dimensions distinguishable in a microscope: an
exact determination of actual atomic dimensions
is #en possible. On the other hand, had the
prediction of this movement proved to be in-
correct, a weighty argument would be provided
against the molecular-kinetic conception of heat.

§ 1. ON THE OsMOTIC PRESSURE TO BE ASCRIBED
TO THE SUSPENDED PARTICLES

Let z gram-molecules of a non-electrolyte be
dissolved in a volume V* forming part of a
quantity of liquid of total volume VY. If the
volume V* is separated from the pure solvent
by a partition permeable for the solvent but
impermeable for the solute, a so-called ‘* osmotic
pressure,”’ ~, is exerted on this partition, which
satisfies the equation

pV*=RTz . - @)
when V*/z is sufficiently great.

On the: other hand, if small suspended particles
are present in the fractional volume V* in place
of the dissolved substance, which particles are also
unable to pass through the partition permeable to
the solvent: according to the classical theory of

MOVEMENT OF SMALL PARTICLES 3

thermodynamics —atleast when the force of gravity
(which does not interest us here) is ignored—we
would not expect to find any force acting on the
partition ; for according to ordinary conceptions
the ‘‘ free energy” of the system appears to be
independent of the position of the partition and
of the suspended particles, but dependent only
on the total mass and qualities of the suspended
material, the liquid and the partition, and on the
pressure and temperature. Actually, for the cal-
culation of the free energy the energy and entropy
of the boundary-surface (surface-tension forces)
should also be considered ; these can be excluded
if the size and condition of the surfaces of contact
do not alter with the changes in position of the
partition and of the suspended particles under
consideration.

But a different conception is reached from
the standpoint of the molecular-kinetic theory of
heat. According to this theory a dissolved mole-
cule is differentiated from a suspended body
solely by its dimensions, and it is not apparent
why a number of suspended particles should not
produce the same osmotic pressure as the same
number of molecules. We must assume that the
suspended particles perform an irregular move-
ment—even if a very slow one—in the liquid, on

--- Page 4 ---
4 THEORY OF BROWNIAN MOVEMENT

account of the molecular movement of the liquid ;
if they are prevented from leaving the volume V*
by the partition, they will exert a pressure on the
partition just like molecules in solution. Then,
if there are suspended particles present in the
volume V*, and therefore »/V* = » in a unit of
volume, and if neighbouring particles are suffi-
ciently far separated, there will be a corresponding
osmotic pressure of magnitude given by
RT 2 _ RT
P= aN”

where N signifies the actual number of molecules
contained in a gram-molecule. It will be shown
in the next paragraph that the molecular-kinetic
theory of heat actually leads to this wider con-
ception of osmotic pressure.

6 THEORY OF BROWNIAN MOVEMENT

Now let us consider a quantity of liquid enclosed
in a volume V; let there be ” solute molecules
(or suspended particles respectively) in the por-
tion V* of this volume V, which are retained in
the volurne ¥* by a semi-permeable partition ;
the integration limits of the integral B obtained
in the expressions for S and F will be affected
accordingly. The combined. volume of the solute
molecules (or suspended particles) is taken as
small compared with V*, This system will be
completely defined according to the theory under
discussion by the variables of conditiong, . . . £1.

Ii the molecular picture were extended to deal
with every single unit, the calculation of the
integral B would offer such difficulties that an
exact: calculation of F could be scarcely contem-
plated. Accordingly, we need here only to know
how F depends on the magnitude of the volume
V*, in which all the solute molecules, or suspended
bodies (hereinafter termed briefly “ particles”)
are contained.

We will call «3, y,, 2, the rectangular Co-ordinates
of the centre of gravity of the first particle,
X, Vs» 2, those of the second, etc., +n, Yn, %» those
of the last particle, and allocate for the centres
of gravity of the particles the indefinitely small
domains of parallelopiped form dx,, dy,, dz; dx,

dy, dz, .. . Am, dyn, dz, lying wholly within
v*. The value of the integral appearing in the
expression for F will be sought, with the limita-
tion that the centres of gravity of the particles
lie within a domain defined in this manner. The
integral can then be brought into the form

dB = dx, dy,...d%. J,

where J is independent of dx,, dy,, etc., as well as
of V*, ie. of the position of the semi-permeable
partition. But J is also independent of any
special choice of the position of the domains of
the centres of gravity and of the magnitude of
v¥*, as will be shown immediately. For if a
second system were given, of indefinitely small
domains of the centres of gravity of the particles,
and the latter designated dx,'dy,'dzy' ; dx,'dyo'dzq'
. « « Un! dyn'dz,', which domains differ from those
originally given in their position but not in their
magnitude, and are similarly all contained in V*,
an analogous expression holds :—
dB! = dx,'dyy' ... dzn' . J’.

Whence

dxdy,... d&y = dx,dyy'... dz,'.
Therefore

dB

--- Page 6 ---
8 THEORY OF BROWNIAN MOVEMENT

But from the moleculartheory of Heat given in the
paper quoted,(*) it is easily deduced that dB/B (4)
(ordB’/B respectively) is equal to the probability
that at any arbitrary moment of time the centres
of gravity of the particles are included in the
domains (d%,... dz,) or (dx,'... d%,") respec-
tively. Now, if the movements of single particles
are independent of one another to a sufficient
degree of approximation, if the liquid is homo-
geneous and exerts no force on the particles, then
for equal size of domains the probability of each
of the two systems will be equal, so that the follow-
ing holds :

B B'
But from this and the last equation obtained it
follows that

J=J.
We have thus proved that J is independent both
of ¥* and of #, ¥4,...%. By integration we
obtain

It has been shown by this analysis that the exist-
ence of an osmotic pressure can be deduced from
the molecular-kinetic theory of Heat; and that
as far as osmotic pressure is concerned, solute
molecules and suspended particles are, according
to this theory, identical in their behaviour at
great dilution.

§ 3. THEORY OF THE DIFFUSION OF SMALL
SPHERES IN SUSPENSION

Suppose there be suspended particles irregularly
dispersed in a liquid. We will consider their
state of dynamic equilibrium, on the assumption
that a force K acts on the single particles, which
force depends on the position, but not on the time.
It will be assumed for the sake of simplicity that
the force is exerted everywhere in the direction of
the x axis.

Let » be the number of suspended particles per
unit volume; then in the condition of dynamic
equilibrium v is such a function of « that the varia-
tion of the free energy vanishes for an arbitrary
virtual displacement 8% of the suspended sub-
stance. We have, therefore,

8F = dE — TSS =o.

--- Page 7 ---
10 THEORY OF BROWNIAN MOVEMENT

It will be assumed that the liquid has unit area
of cross-section perpendicular .to the * axis and
is bounded by the planes ¥ = 0 and x =/, We
have, then,

The required condition of equilibrium is there-
fore

or

The last equation states that equilibrium with the
force K is brought about by osmotic pressure
forces.

Equation (1) can be used to find the coefficient
of diffusion of the suspended substance. We can
look upon the dynamic equilibrium condition con-
sidered here as a superposition of two processes
proceeding in opposite directions, namely :—

1. A movement of the suspended substance
under the influence of the force K acting on each
single suspended particle.

MOVEMENT OF SMALL PARTICLES 11

2. A process of diffusion, which is to be looked
upon as a result of the irregular movement of the
particles produced by the thermal molecular
movement.

If the suspended particles have spherical form
(radius of the sphere = P), and if the liquid has
a coefficient of viscosity k, then the force K im-
parts to the single particles a velocity (*)

The coefficient of diffusion of the suspended sub-

constants and the absolute temperature) only on
the coefficient of viscosity of the liquid and on the
size of the suspended particles.

§ 4. ON THE IRREGULAR MOVEMENT OF ParTICLES
SUSPENDED IN A LIQUID AND THE RELATION
OF THIS TO DIFFUSION

We will turn now to a closer consideration of
the irregular movements which arise from thermal
molecular movement, and give rise to the diffusion
investigated in the last paragraph.

Evidently it must be assumed that each single
particle executes a movement which is indepen-
dent of the movement of all other particles; the
movements of one and the same particle after

MOVEMENT OF SMALL PARTICLES 13

different intervals of time must be considered as
mutually independent processes, so long as we
think of these intervals of time as being chosen
not too small.

We will introduce a time-interval 7 in our dis-
cussion, which is to be very small compared with
the observed interval of time, but, nevertheless,
of such a magnitude that the movements executed
by a particle in two consecutive intervals of time
7 are to be considered as mutually independent
phenomena (8).

Suppose there are altogether 1 suspended par-
ticles in a liquid. In an interval of time 7 the
x-Co-ordinates of the single particles will increase
by A, where 4 has a different value (positive or
negative) for each particle. For the value of 4
a certain probability-law will hold ; the'number
dn of the particles which experience in the time-
interval + a displacement which lies between 4
and 4 + aA, will be expressed by an equation of

the form
dn = nd(4)dA,
where

+o
j +2 6(A)ad = x
and ¢ only differs from zero for very small values
of A and fulfils the condition
$(4) = ¢(— 4).

--- Page 9 ---
14 THEORY OF BROWNIAN MOVEMENT

We will investigate now how the coefficient of
diffusion depends on ¢, confining ourselves again
to the case when the number v of the particles per
unit volume is dependent only on # and ¢.

Putting for the number of particles per unit
volume v = f(x, 4), we will calculate the distri-
bution of the particles at a time ¢-+ 7 from the
distribution at the time 4. From the definition
of the function +(A), there is easily obtained the

number of the particles which are located at the.

time 4 + 7 between two planes perpendicular to
the x-axis, with absciss « and « + dx. We get

fe, t+ ode = dx, j- fe + aypayad.
Now, since 7 is very small, we can put
Keé t+ =f, + wv
Further, we can expand f(x + 4, 4) in powers

of A

We can bring this expansion under the integral
sign, since only very small values of 4 contribute
anyone to the latter. We ‘obtain

On the right-hand side the second, fourth, etc.,
terms vanish since $(x) = ¢(— x) ; whilst of the
first, third, fifth, etc., terms, every succeeding
term is very small compared with the preceding.
Bearing in mind that

+o

and putting

If 4

and taking into consideration only the first and
third terms on the right-hand side, we get from
this equation

(z) af = pt.

oe ox?"

This is the well-known differential equation for
diffusion, and we recognise that D is the coefficient
of diffusion.

Another important consideration can be related
to this method of development. We have assumed
that the single particles are all referred to the
same Co-ordinate system. But this is unneces-
sary, since the movements of the single particles
are mutually independent. We will now refer
the motion of each particle to a co-ordinate

--- Page 10 ---
16 THEORY OF BROWNIAN MOVEMENT

system whose origin coincides at the time ¢ = o
with the position of the centre of gravity of the
particles in question; with this difference, that
S(%, #)dx now gives the number of the particles
whose x Co-ordinate has increased between the
time # =o and the time ¢=#, by a quantity
which lies between x and * + dx. In this case
also the function f must satisfy, in its changes,
the equation (1). Further, we must evidently

have €orx z o andi =a,

foe
Sf, = 0 and f S(%, dx = n.

The problem, which accords with the problem of
the diffusion outwards from a point (ignoring pos-
sibilities of exchange between the diffusing par-
ticles) is now mathematically completely defined
(g) ; the solution is

n eva
J4nD Ji

The probable distribution of the resulting dis-
placements in a given time ¢ is therefore the same
as that of fortuitous error, which was to be ex-
pected. But it is significant how the constants in
the exponential term are related to the coefficient
of diffusion. We will now calculate with the help

MOVEMENT OF SMALL PARTICLES 17

of this equation the displacement A, in the direc-
tion of the X-axis which a particle experiences on
an average, or—more accurately expressed—the
square root of the arithmetic mean of the squares
of displacements in the direction of the X-axis;
it is
waVai= Jai. - (tt)
The mean displacement is therefore propor-
tional to the square root of the time. It can
easily be shown that the square root of the mean
of the squares of the total displacements of the
particles has the value Aw/3 . « (12)

as the liquid (& == 1-35 . 107), and the diameter of
the particles-oor mm. We get
A, = 8I0-§ cm. = o-8u,
The mean displacement in one minute would be,
therefore, about 6p.
On the other hand, the relation found can be
used for the determination of N. We obtain
