XXXV. A Tentative Theory of Light Quanta.
By Lours pr Broerrm *.

I, The Light Quantum.

Tt experimental evidence accumulated in recent years
seems to be quite conclusive in favour of the actual
reality of light quanta. The photoelectric effect, which is
the chief mechanism, of energy exchange between radiation
and matter, seems with increasing probability. to be always
governed by Einstein’s photoelectric law. Hxperiments on
the photographic actions, the recent results of A. H. Compton
on the change in wave-length of. scattered X-rays, would
be very difficult to explain without using the notion of the
light quantum. On the theoretical side Bohr’s theory, which
is supported by so many experimental proofs, is grounded
on the postulate that atoms can only emit or absorb
radiant energy of frequency v by finito amounts equal to
lw, and Finstein’s theory of energy fluctuations in the
black radiation leads us necessarily to the same ideas.

I shall in the present paper assume the real existence
of light quanta, and try to see how it would be possible
to reconcile with it the strong experimental evidence on
which was based the wave theory.

For the sake of simplicity, it is a very natural assumption
to admit that all light quanta are identical and ‘that only

their velocities are different. We shall then assume that the
“mass at rest’? of every light quantum has a given
value my: since the atoms of light have velocities very
nearly equal to the Hinstein’s limiting velocity. ¢, they
must have an extremely small mass (not infinitely smail
in a mathematical sense) ; the frequency of the corre-
sponding radiation must be related to the whole energy
of a quantum by the relation

amo =°),
ha = Ti (s= ‘i
but, since 1—@? is very small, we can write

The light quanta would have velocities of slightly different
values, but such that they cannot be diseriminated from ¢ b
any experimental means. It then seems that my should be
at most of the order of 10~° gr.

Naturally, the light quantum must have an internal binary
symmetry corresponding to the symmetry of an. clectro-
magnetic wave and defined by some axis of polarization.
We shall refer again later to this remark.

Il. The Black Radiation as a Gas of Light Quanta.

Let us consider a gas made up by the light quanta we
have described above. At a given temperature (not too
near to the absolute zero) almost all these atoms of light
would have velocities v= 8c very nearly equal to «. The
whole energy of one of these atoms is

The pressure of such a gas on the walls of the enclosure is
easily seen to be

if m is the number of light quanta in an element of volume.

This expression is the same as the one given by the electro-
magnetic theory, whilst without using the Relativity formule
wwe should have found a result twice as great as this.

Now the question arises, Can we use for the quanta gas
Maxwell’s energy partition law? In Hinstein’s dynamics,
Liouville’s theorem, on which is based all Statistical
Dynamics, is still valid; we can then use for the cle-
mentary cell of extension-in-phase a value proportional to
du dy dzdpdgdr, if 2, y, = ave rectangular coordinates
and p,q? the corresponding momenta. In consequence
of the canonical distribution law, the number of atoms whose
representative poimts are in the element da dy de dp dq dr

This is obviously Wien’s limiting form of the radiation law.

theses made by Planck that the element of extension in

phase was pee dy dzdpdgdr, it was possible to find for
8

the radiant energy density the value

u, dy are v8 git dy,

This was an encouraging result, but not quite complete.
The assumption of finite elements of extension in phase
seemed to have a somewhat arbitrary and mysterious
character. Moreover, Wien’s law is only a limiting form
of the actual radiation law, and I was obliged to suppose
some kind of quanta aggregation for explaining the other
terms of the series,

It seems that these difficulties are now removed, but we
shall first of all explain many other ideas ; we shall later on
return to the “ black radiation” gas.

III. An important Theorem on the Motion of Bodies.

Let us consider a moving body whose “mass at rest”
is mg; it moves with regard to a given observer with
velocity v=Be (8<1). In consequence of the principle of
energy inertia, it must contain an internal energy equal to mec’.
Moreover, the quantum relation suggests the ascription of
this internal energy to a periodical phenomenon whose fre-

quency is Yo 7, moe". For the fixed observer, the whole

energy is

and the corresponding frequency is

But it the fixed observer is looking at the internal
periodical phenomenon, he will see its trequency lowered
and equal to »,=v,/1—, that is to say this phenomenon
seems for him to vary as sin2av,t. The frequency 1 is
widely different from the frequency y; but they are related
by an important theorem which gives us the physical interpre-
tation of v.

Let us suppose that, at time 0, the moving body coincides
in space with a wave whose frequency y has the value given

2
above and which spreads with velocity a=5° This wave,

&
however, cannot carry energy, aceording to Hinstein’s ideas,
Oar theorem is the following :—* Jf, at the beginning, the
internal phenomenon of the moving body is in phase with
the wave, this harmony of phase will always persist.’ In
fact, at time ¢, the moving body is at a distance from tue
origin # = vé and its internal phenomenon is proportional

: ie . .
to sin 2am,—; at the same place the wave is given by
v

sin 2orv 1—F2) = sin 2m a(2—2), The two sines will
be equal; the harmony of phase will again occur if the
following condition is realized :

vw, = v(1—),

a condition clearly satisfied by the definitions of vy and y.
This important result is implicitly contained in Lorentz’s

time transformation. If 7 ‘is ‘the local time of an observer

carried along with the moving body, he will define the

We are then inclined to admit that any moving body may
be accompanied by a wave and that it is impossible to disjoin
motion of body and propagation of wave.

This idea can also be expressed in another way. A group
of waves whose frequencies are very nearly equal has a
‘group velocity’ U, which has been studied by the late
Lord Rayleigh, and which in the usual theory is the velocity
of “energy propagation.” This group velocity is linked
with the “ phase velocity” V by the relation

and velocities = corresponding to very slightly diferent

values of 8.”

IV. Dynamics and Geometrical Optics,

Trying to extend the former ideas to the case of variable
velocity is a rather difficult but very suggestive problem.
J£ in any medium a moving body describes a curved path.
we say that there is a field of foree ; at each point the
potential energy may be calculated, and the body when
crossing this point has a velocity determined. by the constant
value of its whole energy, Now, it seems natural to suppose
that the phase wave must have at any point a velocity and a
frequency fixed by the value which B would have if the
body were there. During its propagation the phase wave
has a constant frequency vy and a constantly variable
velocity V.

Perhaps a new electromagnetism will give us the laws of
this complicated propagation, but it seems that we know
beforehand the final result: “ The rays of the phase wave
are identical with the paths which are dynamically possible.”
In fact, the paths of the rays can be computed as in a
medium of variable dispersion by means of Fermat’s
principle, which may be written here (a wave-length,
ds element of path) :

‘ds _ x {'vds_ .(" moBe
| x= | w= 3 | Vine = 0.

The principle of least action in its Maupertuisian form
gives the dynamical paths by the equation

moBe
vie = 0,
a result which justifies the above statement.

It is now so simple a matter to show that the theorem of
phase harmony is always valid that it seems not necessary to
develop the proof.

The present theory suggests an interesting oxplanation of
Bohr’s stability conditions. At time 0 the electron is in a
point A of its trajectory. The phase wave starting at this
instant from A will deseribe all the path and meet again the
electronin A’. It seems quite necessary that the phase wave
shall find the electron in phase with itself. This is to say:
«The motion can only be stable if the phase wave is tuned
with the length of the path.” The tune relation is then :

(x whele number ; T revolution period),

Now, we can write the stability condition of the quantum
theory in a general form given by Einstein which degenerates
into the manifold Sommerteld’s conditions for quasi-periodical
cases in consequence of the infinite number of the pseudo-
periods. Let us call py, py'p, the momenta ; then Hinstein’s
general condition is

V. The Propagation of Light Quanta and the Coherence
Problem.

We will now make use of our results for studying the
propagation of free light quanta whose velocities are always
slightly lower than ¢. We can say: “The atom of light
whose whole energy is equal to fv is the seat of an internal
periodical phenomenon which, for a fixed observer, has at
each point of space the same phase as a wave spreading in
the same direction with velocity very nearly equal to ¢
(very little greater).” Tho light quantum is in some manner
a part of the wave, but for explaining interferences and
other phenomena of the wave optics it is necessary to see
how several light quanta can be parts of the same wave,
This is the coherence problem.

In the light quanta, theory, it seems necessary to make
the following hypothesis: “ When a phase wave crosses an
excited atom, this atom has a certain probability of emitting
a light quantum determined at each instant by the intensity
of the wave.” Perhaps this hypothesis will seem arbitary,
but I think that any theory of coherence must adopt some
postulate of this kind.

The emissions of y-rays by radioactive substances are
known. to be quite independent, but this cannot be con-
sidered as an objection against our view because the “mean
life” of any. known radioactive atom is always so much
greater than the period of the y-rays.

Thus when an atom emits a light quantum, a spherical
phase wave is simultaneously emitted and, crossing over the
neighbouring’ atoms of the point source, will excite other
emissions. ‘Che non-material phase wave will carry many
little drops of energy which slide slowly upon it and whose
internal phenomena are coherent.

VI. Diffraction by a Screen Edge and the Inertia Principle.

The corpuscular theory of light meets here a great diff-
culty, Ibis known since Newton that the light rays passing
within a short distance of a screen edge are no longer straight

Tentative Theory of Light Quanta, 453

but that some penetrate into the geometrical shadow. Newton
ascribed this deviation to the action of some forces which
would be exerted by the edge upon the light corpuscle. It
seems to me that this phenomenon is .perhaps worthy of a
more general explanation. Since an intimate connexion
soems to exist between motion of bodies and propagation of
waves, and since the rays of the phase wave may now be
considered as the paths (the possible paths) of the energy
quanta, we are inclined to give up the inertia principle and
to say :.“¢A moving body must always follow the’ same ray
of its phase wave.” In the continuous spreading of the
svave, the form of the surfaces of equal phase will change
continuously and the body will always follow the common
perpendicular to two infinitely near surfaces.

When Fermat’s principle is no longer valid for computing
the vay path, the principle of least action is no longer valid
for computing the body path. I think that these ideas may
he considered as a kind of synthesis of optics and dynamics.

We must still specify some points. ‘The ray which now
assumes in our ideas an important physical significance
may be defined as above by the continuous spreading of a
small part of the phase wave ; it cannot be defined at each
point by the geometrical sum for all the waves of the vector
which is called in electromagnetic theory “radiant or
Poynting’s vector.” Let us consider a sort of Wiener’s
experiment. We send a train of plane waves on a perfectly
reflecting plane mixror in the normal direetion; standing
waves are set up; the reflecting mirror is a nodal plane for
the electric vector, the plane at a distance 4’ from the
mirror is a nodal plane for the magnetic vector, the plane at
a distance 44 of the mirror is again a nodal plane for the
electric vector, and so on. In each nodal plane the radiant
vector is null, May we say that these planes are not crossed
by any energy? Evidently not, we can only say that the
interference states in these planes are always the same. In
avery interference case we should tind similar intricacies.
In the wave theory, the propagation of energy has a some~
what fictitious character, but, in return, the exact calculation
of the interference fringes is easily made; we shall try in
the next paragraph to see why it is so.

VIL. A new Explanation of Interference Fringes.
Consider how we can detect the presence of light ata point
in space—by direct perception of the scattered light, by
photographic tests, by calorific effects, and perhaps by some

other means. It seems that all these means can, in fact, be
reduced to photoelectric actions and scattering. Now, when
a light quantum crosses a material atom, it has a certain
probability of being absorbed or scattered, which can depend
on external agencies. If then a theory succeeds in deter-
mining these probabilities without taking account of the
actual motion of energy, it may be able to predict correctly
the ayerage reaction between radiation and matter at each
place. Following the electromagnetic theory (and Bohr’s
correspondence principle is consistent with this view) I have
been inclined to suppose that, for a material atom, the pro-
bability of absorbing or scattering a light quantum is deter-
mined by the geometrical sum of one of the defining vectors
of the phase waves crossing upon it. The last hypothesis
is, in fact, quite analogous to that which is admitted by
electromagnetic theory when it links intensity of disclosable
light with the intensity of the resultant electric vector.
Thus, in the Wiener’s experiment, the photographic action
only oceurs in the nodal planes of the electric vector;
according to the electromagnetic theory, the luminous mag-
netic energy is not disclosable.

Let us now consider Young’s interference experiment.
Some atoms of light pass through the holes and diffract
along the ray of the neighbouring part of their phase waves.
In the space behind the wall, their capacity of photoelectric
action will vary from point to point according to the inter-
ference state of the two phase waves which have crossed the
two holes. We shall then see interference fringes, however
small may be the number of diffracted quanta, however
feeble may be the incident light intensity. The light quanta
do cross all the dark and bright fringes; only their ability
to act on matter is constantly changing. This kind of
explanation, which seems to remove at the same time the
objections against light quanta and against the energy pro-
pagation through dark fringes, may be generalized for all
interference and diffraction phenomena.

VII. The Quanta and the Dynamical Theory of Gases.

For the sake of calculating the entropy constants and the
so-called “chemical constants,” Planck and Nernst have
been obliged to introduce the quantum idea into the theory
of gases. As explained above, Planck chooses an element of
extension in phase equal to

ean dy dzdpdgqdr or a gh? /2Qw dw da dy dz.

We shall now try to justify this assumption,

frequency a Vine , and group velocity U=fc. The

state of the gas can only be stable if the waves corre-
sponding to all the atoms make up a system of standing
waves. Using a well-known methed given by Jeans, we
find for the number of waves per unit of volume whose
frequencies are included in the interval »,»+dv*:

sponding frequency, then :

where 4 =——j-

It is now very easy to find that n,dv is given by the
equation :

nly = a magto(L +a)Va(2+a) dw.

Each phase wave can curry with it one, two, or more atoms,
so that, according to the canonical law, the number of atoms
whose energy is 4.v, will be proportional to:

Let us first consider a material gas whose atoms have
relatively great mass ‘and relatively small velocities. We
can then neglect all the terms of the series except the first,
and we can-also put L+a==1. The number of atoms whose
kinetic energy is w will be, neglecting a constant factor,

a result which justifies Planck’s method and leads. to the
usual form of Maxwell’s law.

In the case of the light quanta gas « is always great, and,
moreover, we must use all the series, In consequence of the

A method developed in the Journal de Physique, of
November 1922, shows that the proportionality factor. is

TX. Open Questions.

The conceptions stated in this paper, if they are received,
will necessitate a wide modification of the electromagnetic
theory. ‘he so-called ‘electric and magnetic energies”
must be only a kind of average value, all the real energy of
the fields being probably of a corpuscular fine-grained struc-
ture. Tho building up of a new electromagnetism seems to
be a very difficult task, but we have’ one directive idea:
according to the correspondence principle and to the above
statements, the defining vectors of the old electromagnetic
theory would give the probability of the reaction between
matter and the fine-grained energy.

The new electromagnetism will give the solution of many

roblems. The laws of propagation of waves given by
Faxwell’s theory will probably be valid for the energyless
light phase waves, and the scattering of the radiant energy
will be explained by the resulting curvature of the rays
(viz., light quanta paths). There seems to be a great
analogy between scattering of radiation and scattering of
corpuscles ; lowering of particles’ velocities by crossing
through a screen may also be similar to the lowering of
X-ray frequencies by scattering, which recently has been
computed and experimentally checked by A. H.. Compton.

Explaining optical dispersion will be more difficult. The
classical theories (including the electron theory) gives only
an average view of this phenomenon, which is produced by
complex elementary reactions between radiation and atoms ;
we shall certainly be obliged here also to distinguish ac-
curately the real motion of energy from the propagation of
the resulting interference state: The kind of “resonance”
shown by the variations of refractive index seems no longer
to be irreconcilable with discontinuity of light.

Many other questions remain open : What is the mechanism

--- Page 13 ---
Downloaded At: 17:39 25 May 2010

Tentative Theory of Light Quanta. 457

of Bragg’s absorption? What occurs when an atom passes
from a stable state to another, and how does it eject a single
quantum? How may we introduce the granular structure
of energy into our conceptions of elastic waves and into
Debyo’s theory of specific heats?

Finally, we must remark that .the quantum relation
remains still a kind of postulate defining the constant h
whose actual significance is not at all cleared up ; but it
seems that the quantum enigma is now reduced to this
unique point.

Summary.

In the present paper it is assumed that the light is
essentially made up of light quanta, all having the same
extraordinarily small mass. It is shown mathematically
that the Lorentz-Kinstein transformation joined with the
quantum relation leads us necessarily to associate motion
of body and propagation of wave, and that this idea gives a
physical interpretation of Bohy’s analytical stability con-
ditions. Diffraction seems to be consistent with an exten-
sion of the Newtonian Dynamics. It is then possible to
save both the corpuscular and the undulatory characters of
light, and, by means of hypotheses suggested by the electro-
magnetic theory and the correspondence -principle, to give a
plausible explanation of cohorence and interference fringes.
Finally, it is shown why quanta must take a part in the
dynamical theory of gases and how Planck’s law is the
limiting form of Maxwell’s law for a light quanta gas.

Many of these ideas may be criticized and perhaps re-
formed, but it seems that now little doubt should remain of
the real existence of light quanta. Moreover, if our opinions
are received, as they are grounded on the relativity of time,
all the enormous experimental evidence of the “quantum ”
will turn in favour of Binstein’s conceptions.
