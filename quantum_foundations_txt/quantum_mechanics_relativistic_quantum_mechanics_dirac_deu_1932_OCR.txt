Relativistic Quantum Mechanics.
By P. A. M. Dirac, F.R.S., St. John’s College, Cambridge.
(Received March 24, 1932.)

$1. Introduction.

The steady development of the quantum theory that has taken place during
the present century was made possible only by continual reference to the
Correspondence Prineiple of Bohr, according to which, classical theory can give
valuable information about quantum phenomena in spite of the essential
differences in the fundamental ideas of the two theories. A masterful advance
was made by Heisenberg in 1925, who showed how equations of classical
physies could be taken over in a formal way and made to apply to quantities
of importance in quantum theory, thereby establishing the Correspondence
Principle on a quantitative basis and laying the foundations of the new
Quantum Mechanies. Heisenberg’s scheme was found to fit wonderfully well
with the Hamiltonian theory of elassical mechanies and enabled one to apply
to quantum theory all the information that classical theory supplies, in so far
as this information is consistent with the Hamiltonian form, Thus one was
able to build up a satisfactory quantum mechanies for dealing with any
dynamical system composed of interacting particles, provided the interaction
could be expressed by means of an energy term to be added to the Hamiltonian
function.

This does not exhaust the sphere of usefulness of the classical theory.
Classical eleetrodynamics, in its accurate (restricted) relativistie form, teaches
us that the idea of an interaction energy between particles is only an approxi-
mation and should be replaced by the idea of each particle emitting waves,

which travel outward with a finite veloeity and influence the other particles
in passing overthem. We must find a way of taking over this new information
into the quantum theory and must set up a relativistic quantum mechanics,
before we can dispense with the Correspondence Prineiple.

A preliminary attack on the question of relativistie quantum mechanies has
been made through the solution of the problem of a single charged particle
moving in a specified classical field. For the treatment of this problem it is
essential to use Schrödinger’s form of quantum mechanies, according to which
the motion of the particle is described by a wave function involving the space
and time co-ordinates in a symmetrical manner. The solution is satisfactory
from the point of view of the Correspondence Principle, although it involves a
diffieulty owing to the appearance of possible negative energy values for the
particle. The diffieulty is not due to a misuse of classical information and
will not concern us here.

The extension of this wave-function method to two or more partieles can
easily be made so long as we keep to the idea of a given classical field in which
the particles are moving. The resulting theory is logically satisfactory, but
is, of course, incomplete, as it gives no interaction between the particles. It
becomes necessary then to abandon the idea of a given classical field and to have
instead a field which is of dynamical significance and acts in accordance with
quantum laws.

An attempt at a comprehensive theory on these lines has been made
by Heisenberg and Pauli.* These authors regard the field itself as
a dynamical system amenable to Hamiltonian treatment and its inter-
action with the particles as deseribable by an interaction energy, so
that the usual methods of Hamiltonian quantum mechanics may be
applied. There are serious objections to these views, apart from the purely
mathematical diffieulties to which they lead. If we wish to make an
observation on a system of interacting partieles, the only effective method of
procedure is to subject them to a field of electromagnetie radiation and see how
they react. Thus the röle of the field is to provide a means for making observa-
tions. The very nature of an observation requires an interplay between the field
and the particles. We cannot therefore suppose the field to be a dynamical
system on the same footing as the partieles and thus something to be observed
in the same way as the particles. 'The field should appear in the theory as
something more elementary and fundamental.

Again, the field equations are always linear and thus of the form typical of

the wave equation of quantum theory. This suggests deep-lying connections
and possibilities for simplification and unification which are entirely lacking in
the Heisenberg-Pauli theory.

In the present paper a scheme is proposed which gives the interplay between
partieles and field apparently correctly and in a surprisingly simple manner.
Full use is made of all the information supplied by the classical theory. The
general ideas are applicable with any kind of simple harmonic wave transmitting
the interaction between partieles and providing the means of observation of
particles (e.g., with longitudinal waves like sound waves) and not merely for
the electromagnetie case, though presumably only the latter is of interest in
atomic theory.

$2. Relativistie Observations.

A definite advance in the relativistic theory of the interaction of two electrons
is contained in a recent paper by Möller,* where it is shown that in the calcu-
lation of the mutual scattering of two colliding electrons by Born’s method of
approximation, one may describe the interaction with retarded potentials
and use relativistic ideas throughout, without getting any ambiguity in the
scattering coefficient to the first order of approximation. This lack of
ambiguity is ground of presumption of the correctness of the result. When,
however, one tries to apply similar methods to the higher approximations or
to more general problems, one meets very definitely with ambiguities.

The method by which Möller obtained his result may be compared with the
methods of the Correspondence Principle in use before the introduction of
Heisenberg’s matrix theory, for caleulating Einstein’s A and B coefficients from
classical models. In certain cases the result obtained was unambiguous
(usually those cases for which the result was zero) and was then presumed to
be correct. In general, howeveı, there was ambiguity, so that one could get
no reliable accurate result.

This analogy suggests that it would be useless to try to extend Möller’s
method by setting up rules to provide a definite interpretation for ambiguous
quantities. Any attempts in this direetion would be just as futile as the
attempts made in the pre-Heisenberg epoch to caleulate Einstein’s A’s and B’s
from some sort; of mean of classical quantities referring to the initial and final
states. One ought to proceed on quite different lines, namely by following
the methods introduced by Heisenberg in 1925, which have already met with

such great success for non-relativistic quantum mechanies.

Heisenberg put forward the principle that one should confine one’s attention
to observable quantities, and set up an algebraie scheme in which only these
observable quantities appear. Strietly speaking, it is not the observable
quantities themselves (the Einstein A’s and B’s) that formed the building stones
of Heisenberg’s algebraic scheme, but rather certain more elementary quantities,
the matrix elements, having the observable quantities as the squares of their
moduli. The extra phase quantities introduced in this way are essential.

Let us see what are the corresponding quantities in relativistie theory. To
make a relativistic observation on a system of particles we must, as mentioned
in the introduction, send in some incident electromagnetic radiation and
examine the scattered radiation. The numerical quantity that we observe is
thus the probability of oceurrence of a certain radiative transition process.
This process may be specified by the intensities of the various monochromatie
components of the ingoing and of the outgoing fields of radiation. (We shall
ignore the purely mathematical difievlty that the total number of these com-
ponents is an infinity of a high order.) The phases must not be specified
together with the intensities, as this would violate well-established quantum
principles.

In non-relativistic quantum mechanics the probability of occurrence of any
transition process is always given as the square of the modulus of a certain
quantity, of the nature of a matrix element or simply a transformation function,
zeferring to the initial and final states. It appears reasonable to assume that
this will still be the case in relativistic quantum mechanies. Thus the relativis-
tie observable quantities, which are always transition probabilities, will all
appear as the squares of the moduli of certain quantities. These quantities,
which we shall refer to as probability amplitudes, will then be the building
stones analogous to Heisenberg’s matrix elements. We should expect to be
able to set up an algebraic scheme involving only the probability amplitudes and
io translate the equations of motion of relativistie classical theory directly into
exact equations ewpressible entirely in terms of these quantities.

The information that classical theory supplies is thus to be used to give
relations between the probability amplitudes of different physical processes,
rather than to enable one to calculate a particular one of them. Only in very
special cases, of which Möller’s paper provides an example, is it possible to
evaluate a relativistic transition probability without at the same time evaluating
a whole series of them, referring to all the possible ways in which the particles
under consideration can reaet with the radiation field.

A point of special importance about the building stones of the new theory


--- Page 5 ---
Relativistice Quantum Mechanics. 457

is that each of them refers to one field of ingoing waves and one field of out-
going waves, or to one initial field of a transition process and one final field.
Quantities referring to two initial fields, or to two final fields, are not allowed.
This shows a departure from the theory of Heisenberg and Pauli, according to
which, if one is given any quantity referring to one initial field and one final
field, one can obtain from it a quantity referring to two initial fields, or to
two final fields, by a straightforward application of the transformation theory
of quantum mechanies. The Heisenberg-Pauli theory thus involves many
quantities which are unconneeted with results of observations and which must
be removed from consideration if one is to obtain a elear insight into the under-
lying physical relations.
$ 3. Equations of Motion.

We shall now consider in detail the question of how the information con-
tained in classical electrodynamies can be taken over into the quantum theory.
We meet at once with the diffieulty that the classical theory itself is not free
from ambiguity.

To make the discussion precise, let us suppose we have a single eleetron
interacting with a field of radiation and consider the radiation resolved into
ingoing and outgoing waves. The classical problem is, given the ingoing
radiation and suitable initial conditions for the electron, determine the motion
of the electron and the outgoing radiation. The classical equations which deal
with this problem are of two kinds, (i) those that determine the field produced
by the electron (which field is just the difference of the ingoing and outgoing
fields) in terms of the variables deseribing the motion of the electron, and (ü)
those that determine the motion of the eleetron. Equations (i) are quite
definite and unambiguous, but not so equations (ii). The latter express the
acceleration of the electron in terms of field quantities at the point where the
electron is situated and these field quantities in the complete elassical pieture
are infinite and undefined.

In the usual approximate treatment of the problem one takes for these field
quantities just the contributions of the ingoing waves. This treatment is
necessarily only approximate, since it does not take into account the reaction
on the eleetron of the waves it emits. We should expect in an accurate treat-
ment, that the field determining the acceleration of the electron would be in
some way associated with both the ingoing and outgoing waves. Classical
attempts have been made to improve the theory by assuming a definite struc-
ture for the electron and calculating the effect on one part of it of the field
produced by the rest, but such methods are not permissible in modern physies.

458 P. A.M. Dirac.

We must recognise at this point that we have reached the limit of classical
electromagnetic theory. We have quite definite equations for determining
the motion of the electron in terms of field quantities, but we cannot interpret
these field quantities in the usual classical pieture and the most: we can say
about them is that they are related in some non-classical way to two fields,
namely, those of the ingoing and of the outgoing waves. Further advance can
be made only by introducing quantum ideas.

Let us make the assumption that the passage from the field of ingoing waves
to the field of outgoing waves is just a quantum jump performed by one field. This
assumption is permissible on account of the fact, discussed in the preceding
section, that all the quantities in relativistice quantum mechanics are of the
nature of probability amplitudes referring to one ingoing field and one out-
going field, so that we may associate, say, the right-hand sides of the probability
amplitudes with ingoing fields and the left-hand sides with outgoing fields.
In this way we automatically exelude quantities referring to two ingoing fields
or to two outgoing fields and make a great simplification in the foundations of
the theory.

The significance of the new assumption lies in the fact that the classical
picture from which we derive our equations of motion must contain no reference
to quantum jumps. This classical pieture must therefore involve just one
field, a field composed of waves passing undisturbed through the electron and
satisfying everywhere Maxwell’s equations for empty space. With this
pieture the equations of motion for the electron are perfectiy definite and
unambiguous. There are no equations of motion for the field, as the field
throughout space-time is pietured as given. Thus the interaction between
electron and field is introduced into the equations in only one place.

The quantisation of the equations of motion derived from this pieture may
conveniently be carried out in two stages. Let us first quantise only the
variables describing the electron. We then get just the usual quantum theory
of the motion of an electron in a given classical field, with the difference that
in the present case the field must necessarily be resolvable into plane waves
and must therefore contain nothing of the nature of a Coulomb force. We have
a Schrödinger equation of the form

Fl=0,

where the operator F is, neglecting spin

Relativistie Quantum Mechanics. 459

It should be remembered that the wave-function ) involves not only the
variables z, y, z, t deseribing the electron, but also a large number of para-
meters describing the field, which parameters may conveniently be taken to
be the intensities J and phases w of the various Fourier components of the
field. The potentials A occurring in F are likewise functions, not only of the
variables z, %, z, i describing the momentary position of the electron, but also
‚of the parameters J and w.

In the second stage of the quantisation we assume that the J’s and w’s
occurring in ) and the A’s are not numerical, but are operators satisfying
the usual quantum conditions governing the intensities and phases of the
Fourier components of the eleetromagnetie field in empty space. The new
wave equation obtained in this way is to be treated on the same lines as the
previous one. In particular, it may be used to determine matrix elements
associated with electron jumps. Each such matrix element will now be a
function of the non-commuting J’s and w’s, so that, when we take a representa-
tion of the J’s and w’s, it becomes a set of quantities, each referring to two
states of the field as well as the two electronic states, and thus being of the
nature of the probability amplitudes of $ 2.

For the problem of the interaction of two electrons, we require a wave-
function ) which is a function of the variables z,, %,, 21, ti and 3, Ya, 2g, ig
describing the two electrons and of one set of J’s and w’s describing one field.
This ) must satisfy the two wave equations

Fy=0, Fy=0, (2)

where F, is the operator obtained from F by substituting 0/öt,, ete., for 0/öt,
ete., and taking for the A’s their values at the point z,, Yı; 21; &, and similarly
for F,. These two wave equations describe completely the relations between
the two eleetrons and the field. No terms of the type of a Coulomb inter-
action energy are required in the operators of the wave equations. The
interaction of the two electrons is due to the motions of both being connected
with the same field. This interaction manifests itself mathematically through
the fact that, if we take a wave function $,, a function only of &,, Yı, 2, 4 and
the J’s and w’s, satisfying

Rbh=0, (34)

and a second wave-function bs, a function only of x, Yy, 22. iz and the J’s
and w’s, satisfying
F=0, (38)

then neither of the products y,b, and Yay, will satisfy both the wave equations
(2). The solution of equations (2) is an essentially different and more com-
plicated problem than the solution of (3A) and (38).

$4. Interaction between Two Particles in One Dimension.

It may seem rather surprising that a theory in which all the fields are resolv-
able into plane waves can give anything of the nature of the usual eleetrostatie
forces between electrons. We shall therefore illustrate by a simple example
the fact that these forces really are contained in our wave equations. We
shall take the case of two particles moving in a field in one-dimensional space
and shall proceed to solve equations (2), making various approximations that
are permissible when we are not interested in relativistie eflects.

Suppose the field to be describable by a potential funetion V satisfying the

Let us now see what are the Poisson bracket relations between the Fourier
coefficients a and b. These relations must be chosen such that the quantities
a,e®t, b,e"*, considered as dynamical,variables, satisfy equations of motion
of the Hamiltonian form with the Hamiltonian function (5), thus

and similarly for b,. It is easily verified that we must have
[a,, a] = [b,, b,] = ie/v.d8(v-+ v‘)
[a,, d.] = 0.
In the quantum theory these relations become

We now introduce two particles, of masses m, amd m, and “ charges” &,
and e,, and suppose the interaction of each with the field can be described by
an interaction energy equal to its charge multiplied by the value of V at the
point where it is situated. Thus, if we neglect the relativistic variation of mass
with velocity, we have the two wave equations

representing a state for which the particles have the momenta p, and p,, and
all the J’s, ü.e., the intensities of the Fourier components of the field, vanish.
Now the operator e,V (2,2) + e3V (zgt) occurring on the right-hand sides of
(9) and (10), if expressed as a matrix in a representation in which the J’s are
diagonal, would contain only matrix elements referring to transitions in which
just one of the J’s changes by one quantum. It follows that ), must consist
of a sum of terms each referring to a state of the field in which just one oscillation
is excited by one quantum. Similarly , must consist of a sum of terms each
referring either to a two-quantum or to a zero-quantum state of the field.
The latter are the ones that interest vs here, as they may be compared with the
terms that would arise from the insertion of an: interaction energy between the
two particles into the operator of the wave equation (7).

We can obtain the solution of equation (9) by expanding the right-hand side
in terms of its Fourier components by means of (4) and dividing each component
by the number to which the operator on the left-hand side of (9) is equivalent
when it operates on that component. This gives

When we substitute this value for %, in the right-hand side of (10) and also
substitute for V its expansion given by (4), we obtain an expression consisting
of an operator, which is a homogeneous quadratic function of the a’s and b’s,
operating on ),. We must evaluate that particular part of the expression that
refers to the unexeited state of the field. Only those terms of the operator

involving products like a,a_, or b,b_, will contribute anything to that part.
To obtain the contribution of a term involving a,a_,, we observe that, for
v>0,a,and a_, are like the quantities p + iq and p — iq respectively in
the problem of the simple harmonie oseillator. Thus a,a_,, with v> 0,
is proportional to twice the energy of the corresponding oscillation (without
zero-point energy) so that it gives no contribution when multiplied into &,-
The first of the quantum conditions (6) now shows that, to get the contribution
from a term involving a_,a, with v> 0, we must count a_,a, as equal to
he/v.8(v— v’). In the same way we find that we must count b,b_, = 0 and
b_,b, = he/v.8(v— V) with v>0.

The term on the right-hand side of (10) arising from the product of &,V (z3£)

our wave-equation (7) contains implieitly an interaction between the partieles,
expressible approximately by the interaction energy Zee; |, — x,|. This
interaction energy agrees numerically with what we should expect from a one-
dimensional electrostatie theory. There is, however, a mistake in sign, as it
gives an attractive force between like charges.

Summary.

A quantum theory is proposed in which the interaction between particles
takes place by means of vibrations of an intervening medium transmitted with
a finite veloeity. The fundamental relations involve only quantities having
observational significance, account being taken of the fact that an act of
observation necessarily involves an interplay between particles and field. A
detailed solution of a one-dimensional problem is given in order to show that
forces of electrostatic nature are implieitly contained in the theory.

[Note added, April 20th.—It has been pointed out to me by Professor
Heisenberg that the sign of the interaction energy given by the above
caleulation is really quite correct, since with the one-dimensional, longitudinal
waves there used the classical theory also requires an attractive force
between like charges.]
