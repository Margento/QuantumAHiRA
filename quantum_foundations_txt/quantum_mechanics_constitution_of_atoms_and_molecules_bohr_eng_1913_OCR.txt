I. On the Constitution of Atoms and Molecules,
By N. Bourn, Dr. phil. Copenhagen*.

Introduction.

i order to explain the results of experiments on scattering
of « rays by matter Prof. Rutherfordt has given a
theory of the structure of atoms. According to this theory,
the atoms consist of a positively charged nucleus surrounded
by a system of electrons kept together by attractive forces
from the nucleus; the total negative charge of the electrons
is equal to the positive charge of the nucleus. Further, the
nucleus is assumed to be the seat of the essential part of
the mass of the atom, and to have linear dimensions ex-
ceedingly small compared with the linear dimensions of the
whole atom. The number of electrons in an atom is deduced
to be approximately equal to half the atomic weight. Great
interest is to be attributed to this atom-model; for, as
Rutherford has shown, the assumption of the existence of
nuclei, as those in question, seems to be necessary in order
to account for the results of the experiments on large angle
scattering of the a rayst.
In an attempt to explain some of the properties of matter
on the basis of this atom-model we meet, however, with
difficulties of a serious nature arising from the apparent

instability of the system of electrons: difficulties purposely
avoided in atom-models previously considered, for instance,
in the one proposed by Sir J. J. Thomson*. According to
the theory of the latter the atom consists of a sphere of
uniform positive electrification, inside which the electrons
move in cireular orbits.

The principal difference between the atom-models proposed
by Thomson and Rutherford consists in the circumstance
that the forces acting on the electrons in the atom-model of
Thomson allow of certain configurations and motions of the
electrons for which the system is in a stable equilibrium ;
such configurations, however, apparently do not exist for
the second atom-model. The nature of the difference in
question will perhaps be most clearly seen by noticing that
among the quantities characterizing the first atom a quantity
appears—the radius of the positive sphere—of dimensions
of a length and of the same order of magnitude as the linear
extension of the atom, while such a length does not appear
among the quantities characterizing the second atom, viz.
the charges and masses of the electrons and the positive
nucleus ; nor can it be determined solely by help of the
latter quantities.

The way of considering a problem of this kind has, how-
ever, undergone essential alterations in recent years owing
to the development of the theory of the energy radiation,
and the direct affirmation of the new assumptions introduced
in this theory, found by experiments on very different phe-
nomena such as specific heats, photoelectric effect, Réntgen-
rays, &e. The result of the discussion of these questions
seems to be a general acknowledgment of the inadequacy of
the classical electrodynamics in describing the behaviour of
systems of atomic sizet. Whatever the alteration in the
laws of motion of the electrons may be, it seems necessary
to introduce in the laws in question a quantity foreign to
the classical electrodynamics, i. e. Planck’s constant, or as it
often is called the elementary quantum of action. By the
introduction of this quantity the question of the stable con-
figuration of the electrons in the atoms is essentially changed,
as this constant is of such dimensions and magnitude that it,
together with the mass and charge of the particles, can
determine a length of the order of magnitude required.

This paper is an attempt to show that the application of
the above ideas to Rutherford’s atom-model affords a basis

for a theory of the constitution of atoms. J¢ will further
be shown that from this theory we are led to a theory of the
constitution of molecules.

In the present first part of the paper the mechanism of
the binding of electrons by a positive nucleus is discussed in
relation to Planck’s theory. It will be shown that it is
possible from the point of view taken to account in a simple
way for the law of the line spectrum of hydrogen. Further,
reasons are given for a principal hypothesis on which the
considerations contained in the following parts are based.

T wish here to express my thanks to Prof. Rutherford for
his kind and encouraging interest in this work.

$1. General Considerations.

The inadequacy of the classical electrodynamics in ac-
counting for the properties of atoms from an atom-model as
Rutherford’s, will appear very clearly if we consider a simple
system consisting of a positively charged nucleus of very
small dimensions and an electron deseribing closed orbits
around it. For simplicity, let us assume that the mass of
the electron is negligibly small in comparison with that of
the nucleus, and further, that the velocity of the electron is
small compared with that of light.

Let us at first assume that there is no energy radiation.
In this case the electron will describe stationary elliptical
orbits. The frequency of revolution @ and the major-axis
of the orbit 2a will depend on the amount of energy W
which must be transferred to the system in order to remove
the electron to an infinitely great distance apart from the
nucleus, Denoting the charge of the electron and of the
nucleus by —e and E respectively and the mass of the electron
by m, we thus get

_ 72 Wi 9, ¢h
om hm’ 2a= FF - oe es QQ)
Further, it can easily be shown that the mean value of the
kinetic energy of the eleetron taken for a whole revolution
is equal to W. We see that if the value of W is not given,
there will be no values of w and a characteristic for the
system in question.

Let us now, however, take the effect of the energy radia-
tion into account, calculated in the ordinary way from the
acceleration of the electron. In this case the electron will

no longer describe stationary orbits. W will continuously
increase, and the electron will approach the nucleus de-
scribing orbits of smaller and smaller dimensions, and with
greater and greater frequency ; the electron on the average
gaining in kinetic energy at the same time as the whole
system loses energy. This process will go on until the
dimensions of the orbit are of the same order of magni-
tude as the dimensions of the electron or those of the nucleus.
A simple calculation shows that the energy radiated out
during the process considered will be enormously great
compared with that radiated out by ordinary molecular
processes.

It is obvious that the behaviour of such a system will be
very different from that of an atomic system occurring in
nature. In the first place, the actual atoms in their per-
manent state seem to have absolutely fixed dimensions and
frequencies. Further, if we consider any molecular process,
the result seems always to be that after a certain amount of
energy characteristic for the systems in question is radiated
out, the systems will again settle down in a stable state of
equilibrium, in which the distances apart of the particles are
of the same order of magnitude as before the process.

Now the essential point in Planck’s theory of radiation is
that the energy radiation from an atomic system does not
take place in the continuous way assumed in the ordinary
electrodynamics, but that it, on the contrary, takes place in
distinctly separated emissions, the amount of energy radiated
out from an atomic vibrator of frequency v in a single
emission being equal to thy, where 7 is an entire number,
and / is a universal constant *.

Returning to the simple case of an electron and a positive
nucleus considered above, let us assume that the electron at
the beginning of the interaction with the nucleus was ata
great distance apart from the nucleus, and had no sensible
velocity relative to the latter, Let us further assume that
the electron after the interaction has taken place has
settled down in a stationary orbit around the nucleus. We
shall, for reasons referred to later, assume that the orbit in
question is circular : this assumption will, however, make no
alteration in the calculations for systems containing only a
single electron.

Let us now assume that, during the binding of the electron,
a homogeneous radiation is emitted of a frequency », equal
to half the frequency of revolution of the electron in its final

orbit ; then, from Planck’s theory, we might expect that the
amount of energy emitted by the process considered is equal
to thy, where h is Planck’s constant and 7 an entire number.
If we assume that the radiation emitted is homogeneous, the
second assumption concerning the frequency of the radiation
suggests itself, since the frequency of revolution of the
electron at the beginning of the emission is 0, The question,
however, of the rigorous validity of both assumptions, and
also of the application made of Planck’s theory, will be more
closely discussed in § 3.

If in these expressions we give r different values, we get
a series of values for W, w, and a corresponding to a series
of configurations of the system. According to the above
considerations, we are led to assume that these configurations
will correspond to states of the system in which there is
no radiation of energy; states which consequently will be
stationary as long as the system is not disturbed from out-
side. We see that the value of W is greatest if r has its
smallest value 1. This case will therefore correspond to
the most stable state of the system, i. e. will correspond to
the binding of the electron for the breaking up of which the
greatest amount of energy is required.

We see that these values are of the same order of magni-

frequencies, and the ionization-potentials.

cussion of the behaviour of atomic systems was originally
pointed out by Einstein*. The considerations of Einstein

have been developed and applied on a number of different
phenomena, especially by Stark, Nernst, and Sommerfield.
The agreement as to the order of magnitude between values
observed for the frequencies and dimensions of the atoms,
and values for these quantities calculated by considerations
similar to those given above, has been the subject of much
discussion. It was first pointed out by Haas*, in an attempt
to explain the meaning and the value of Planck’s constant
on the basis of J. J. Thomson’s atom-model, by help of the
linear dimensions and frequency of an hydrogen atom.

Systems of the kind considered in this paper, in which the
forces betwéen the particles vary inversely as the square of
the distance, are discussed in relation to Planck’s theory
by J. W. Nicholsonf. In a series of papers this author
has shown that it seems to be possible to account for lines of
hitherto unknown origin in the spectra of the stellar nebulie
and that of the solar corona, by assuming the presence in these
bodies of certain hy; othetical elements of exactly indicated
constitution. The atoms of these elements are supposed to
consist simply of a ring of a few electrons surrounding a
positive nucleus of negligibly small dimensions. The ratios
between the frequencies corresponding to the lines in question
are compared with the ratios between the frequencies corre-
sponding to different modes of vibration of the ring of
electrons. Nicholson has obtained a relation to Planck’s
theory showing that the ratios between the wave-length of
different sets of lines of the coronal spectrum can be accounted
for with great accuracy by assuming that the ratio between
the energy of the system and the frequency of rotation of the
ring is equal to an entire multiple of Planck’s constant. The
quantity Nicholson refers to as the energy is equal to twice
the quantity which we have denoted above by W. In the
latest. paper cited Nicholson has found it necessary to give
the theory a more complicated form, still, however, repre-
senting the ratio of energy to frequency by a simple function
of whole numbers.

The excellent agreement between the calculated and
observed values of the ratios between the wave-lengths in
question seems a strong argument in favour of the validity
of the foundation of Nicholson’s calculations. Serious

objections, however, may be raised against the theory. These
objections are intimately connected with the problem of the
homogeneity of the radiation emitted. In Nicholson’s cal-
culations the frequency of lines in a line-spectrum is identified
with the frequency ot vibration of a mechanical system in a
distinctly indicated state of equilibrium. As a relation from
Planck’s theory is used, we might expect that the radiation
is sent out in quanta; but systems like those considered, in
which the frequency is a function of the energy, cannot emit
a finite amount of a homogeneous radiation; for, as soon as the
emission of radiation is started, the energy and also the
frequency of the system are altered. Further, according to
the calculation of Nicholson, the systems are unstable for
some modes of vibration. Apart from such objections— which
may be only formal (see p. 23)—it must be remarked, that
the theory in the form given does not seem to be able to
account for the well-known laws of Balmer and Rydberg
connecting the frequencies of the lines in the line-spectra
of the ordinary elements.

It will now be attempted to show that the difficulties in
question disappear if we consider the problems from the
point of view taken in this paper. Before proceeding it may
be useful to restate briefly the ideas characterizing the calev-
lations on p. 5. The principal assumptions used are :

(1) That the dynamical equilibrium of the systems in the
stationary states can be discussed by help of the
ordinary mechanics, while the passing of the systems
between different stationary states cannot be treated
on that basis.

(2) That the latter process is followed by the emission
ot a homogeneous radiation, for which the relation
between the frequency and the amount of energy
emitted is the one given by Planck’s theory.

The first assumption seems to present itself; for it is
known that the ordinary mechanics cannot have an absolute
validity, but will only hold in caleulations of certain mean
values of the motion of the electrons. On the other hand,
in the calculations of the dynamical equilibrium in a stationary
state in which there is no relative displacement of the
particles, we need not distinguish between the actual
imotions and their mean values. The second assumption is
in obvious contrast to the ordinary ideas of electrodynamics,
but appears to be necessary in order to account for experi-
mental facts.

In the calculations on page 5 we have further made use

of the more special assumptions, viz. that the different
stationary states correspond to the emission of a different
number of Planck’s energy-quanta, and that the frequency of
the radiation emitted during the passing of the system from
a state in which no energy is yet radiated out to one of the
stationary states, is equal to half the frequency of revolution
of the electron in the latter state. We can, however (see
§ 3), also arrive at the expressions (3) for the stationary
states by using assumptions of somewhat different form.
We shall, therefore, postpone the discussion of the special
assumptions, and first show how by the help of the above
ptincipal assumptions, and of the expressions (3) for the
stationary states, we can account for the line-spectrum of
hydrogen,

§ 2. Emission of Line-spectra.

Spectrum of Hydrogen.—General evidence indicates that
an atom of hydrogen consists simply of a single ,electron
rotating round a positive nucleus of charge e*. The re-
formation of a hydrogen atom, when the electron has been
removed to great distances away from the nucleus—e. g. by
the effect of electrical discharge in a vacuum tube—will
accordingly correspond to the binding of an electron by a
positive nucleus considered on p. 5. If in (3) we put E=e,
we get for the total amount of energy radiated out by the
formation of one of the stationary states,

* See f. inst. N, Bohr, Phil. Mag. xxv. p. 24 (1913), The conclusion
drawn in the paper cited is strongly supported by the fact that hydrogen,
in the experiments on positive rays of Sir J, J. Thomson, is the only
element which never occurs with a positive charge corresponding to the
loss of more than one electron (comp. Phil. Mag. xxiv. p. 672 (1912)).

We see that this expression accounts for the law connecting
the lines in the spectrum of hydrogen. If we put 7,=2 and

T2=3, we get the series in the ultra-red observed by Paschen*
and previously suspected by Ritz. If we put 7=1 and
tT 2=A4, 5,.., we get series respectively in the extreme ultra-
violet and the extreme ultra-red, which are not observed, but
the existence of which may be expected.

The agreement in question is quantitative as well as
qualitative. Putting

The agreement between the theoretical and observed values
is inside the uncertainty due to experimental errors in the
constants entering in the expression for the theoretical value.
We shall in § 3 return to consider the possible importance
of the agreement in question.

{t may be remarked that the fact, that it has not been
possible to observe more than 12 lines of the Balmer series
in experiments with vacuum tubes, while 33 lines are ob-
served in the spectra of some celestial bodies, is just what we
should expect from the above theory. According to the
equation (3) the diameter of the orbit of the electron in
the different stationary states is proportional to 72. For
7=12 the diameter is equal to 1:6.107%em., or equal to
the mean distance between the molecules in a gas at a
pressure of about 7mm. mercury; for r=33 the diameter
is equal to 1-2 .10~* em., corresponding to the mean distance
of the molecules at a pressure of about 0°02 mm. mercury.
According to the theory the necessary condition for the
appearance of a great number of lines is therefore a very
small density of the gas; for simultaneously to obtain an

intensity sufficient for observation the space filled with the
gas must be very great. If the theory is right, we may
therefore never expect to be able in experiments with vacuum
tubes to observe the lines corresponding to high numbers of
the Balmer series of the emission spectrum of hydrogen; it
might, however, be possible to observe the lines by investi-
gation of the absorption spectrum of this gas (see § 4).

Tt will be observed that we in the above way do not
obtain other series of lines, generally ascribed to hydrogen ;
for instance, the series first observed by Pickering* in the
spectrum of the star ¢ Puppis, and the set of series recently
found by Fowlert by experiments with vacuum tubes
containing a mixture of hydrogen and helium. We shall,
however, see that, by help of the above theory, we can
account naturally for these series of lines if we ascribe them
to helium.

A neutral atom of the latter element consists, according to
Rutherford’s theory, of a positive nucleus of charge 2e and
two electrons. Now considering the. binding of a single
electron by a helium nucleus, we get, putting E=2e in the
expressions (3) on page 5, and proceeding in exactly the same
way as above,

If we in this formula put 72=1 or T,=2, we get series of
lines in the extreme ultra-violet. If we put t,=3, and let
7 vary, we get a series which includes 2 of the series
observed by Fowler, and denoted by him as the first and
second principal series of the hydrogen spectrum. If we put
T,=4, we get the series observed by Pickering in the
spectrum of € Puppis. Every second of the lines in this
series is identical with a line in the Balmer series of
the hydrogen spectrum; the presence of hydrogen in the
star in question may therefore account for the fact that
these lines are of a greater intensity than the rest of the
lines in the series. The series is also observed in the expe-
riments of Fowler, and denoted in his paper as the Sharp
series of the hydrogen spectrum. If we finally in the above
formula put 7,.=5, 6,.. , we get series, the strong lines of

ordinary helium tubes may be that in such tubes the ionization
of helinm is not so complete as in the star considered or in the
experiments of Fowler, where a strong discharge was sent
through a mixture of hydrogen and helium, The condition
for the appearance of the spectrum is, according to the above
theory, that helium atoms are present in a state in which
they have lost both their electrons. Now we must assume
that the amount of energy to be used in removing the second
electron from a helium atom is much greater than that to be
used in removing the first. Further, it is known from expe-
riments on positive rays, that bydrogen atoms can acquire a
negative charge ; therefore the presence of hydrogen in the
experiments of Fowler may effect that more elecirons are
removed from some of the helium atoms than would be the
case if only helium were present.

Spectra of other substances.—In case of systems containing
more electrops we must—in conformity with the result of
experiments—expect more complicated Jaws for the line-
spectra than those considered. I shall try to show that the
peint of view taken above allows, at any rate, a certain
understanding of the laws observed.

According to Rydberg’s theory—with the generalization
given by Ritz *—-the frequency corresponding to the lines of
the spectrum of an element can be expressed by

v=F,(71) —F (re),
where 7, and 7, are entire numbers, and f,, F., F;,.... are

Functions of + which approximately are equal to +a?
baer K is a universal constant, equal to the factor
outside the bracket in the formula (4) for the spectrum of
hydrogen. The different series appear if we put 7; or 7, equal
to a fixed number and let the other vary.

The circumstance that the frequency can be written as a
difference between two functions of entire numbers suggests
an origin of the lines in the spestra in question similar to
the one we have assumed for hydrogen; 7. e. that the lines
correspond to a radiation emitted during the passing of the
system between two different stationary states. For systems
containing more than one electron the detailed discussion
may be very complicated, as there will be many different
configurations of the electrons which can be taken inte con-
sideration as stationary states. This may account for the
different sets of series in the line spectra emitted from the

substances in question. Here 1 shall only try to show how,
by help of the theory, it can be simply explained that the
constant K entering in Rydberg’s formula is the same for all
substances.

Let us assume that the spectrum in question corresponds to
the radiation emitted during the binding of an electron; and
let us further assume that the system including the electron
considered is neutral. The foree on the electron, when at
a great distance apart from the nucleus and the electrons
previously bound, will be very nearly the same as in the above
ease of the binding of an electron by a hydrogen nucleus.
The energy corresponding to one of the stationary states will
therefore for r great. be very nearly equal to that given by
the expression (3) on p. 5, if we put E=e. For rt great we

§ 3. General Considerations continued.

We shall now retura to the discussion (see p. 7) of the
special assumptions used in deducing the expressions (3) on
p. 5 for the stationary states of a system consisting of an
electron rotating round a nucleus.

For one, we have assumed that the different stationary
states correspond to an emission of a different number of
energy-quanta. Considering systems in which the frequency
is a function of the energy, this assumption, however, may
be regarded as improbable; for as soon as one quantum is sent
out the frequency is altered. We shall now see that we can
leave the assumption used and still retain the equation (2)
on p- 5, and thereby the formal analogy with Planck’s
theory.

Wisdly, it will be observed that it has not been necessary,
in order to account for the law of the spectra by help of the
expressions (3) for the stationary states, to assume that in any
ease a radiation is sent out corresponding to more than a
single energy-quantum, Av. Further information on the
frequency of the radiation may be obtained by comparing
calculations of the energy radiation in the region of slow
vibrations based on the above assumptions with calculations
based on the ordinary mechanics. As is known, calculations
on the latter basis are in agreement with experiments on the
energy radiation in the named region.

Let us assume that the ratio between the total amount of

energy emitted and the frequency of revolution of the
electron for the different stationary states is given by
the equation W=/(r).ho, instead of by the equation (2).
Proceeding in the same way as above, we get in this case

Assuming as above that the amount of energy emitted
during the passing of the system from a state corresponding
to r=7, to one for which 7=7, is equal to Av, we get instead

We see that in order to get an expression of the same form
as the Balmer series we must put f(r) =cr.

In order to determine c let us now consider the passing of
the system between two successive stationary states corre-
sponding to T=N and r=N—1; introducing f(r) =cr, we
get for the frequency of the radiation emitted

If N is great the ratio between the frequency before and

to the ordinary electrodynamics we should therefore expect
that the ratio between the frequency of radiation and the
frequency of revolution also is very nearly equal tol. This

condition will only be satisfiedif c=4. Putting (7) =y we,

however, again arrive at the equation (2) and consequently
at the expression (3) for the stationary states.

compared with N, we get with the same approximation as

The possibility of an emission of a radiation of such a
frequency may also be interpreted from analogy with the
ordinary electrodynamics, as an electron rotating round a
nucleus in an elliptical orbit will emit a radiation which
according to Fourier’s theorem can be resolved into homo-
geneous components, the frequencies of which are xo, if @ is
the frequency of revolution of the electron.

We are thus led to assume that the interpretation of the
equation (2) is not that the different stationary states cor-
respond to an emission of different numbers of energy-quanta,
but that the frequency of the energy emitted during the
passing of the system from a state in which no energy is yet
radiated out to one of the different stationary states, is equal

to different multiples of “ where wis the frequency of revo-

lution of the electron in the state considered. From this
assumption we get exactly the same expressions as before for
the stationary states, and from these by help of the principal
assumptions on p. 7 the same expression for the law of the
hydrogen spectrum. Consequently we may regard our pre-
liminary considerations on p. 5 only as a simple form of
representing the results of the theory.

Before we leave the discussion of this question, we shall for
a moment return to the question of the significance of the
agreement between the observed and calculated values of
the constant entering in the expressions (4) for the Balmer
series of the hydrogen spectrum. From the above con-
sideration it will follow that, taking the starting-point in the
form of the law of the hydrogen spectrum and assuming that
the different lines correspond to a homogeneous radiation
emitted during the pussing between different stationary
states, we shall arrive at exactly the same expression for the
constant in question as that given by (4), if we only assume
(1) that the radiation is sent out in quanta Av, and (2) that
the frequency of the radiation emitted during the passing of
the system between successive stationary states will coincide
with the frequency of revolution of the electron in the region
of slow vibrations.

As all the assumptions used in this latter way of repre-
senting the theory are of what we may call a qualitative
character, we are Justified in expecting—if the whole way of
considering is a sound one—an absolute agreement between
the values calculated and observed for the constant in question,
and not only an approximate agreement. The formula (4)
may therefore be of value in the discussion of the results
of experimental determinations of the constants e, m, and h.

While there obviously can be no question of a mechanical
foundation of the calculations given in this paper, it is, how-
ever, possible to give a very simple interpretation of the result
of the calculation on p. 5 by help of symbols taken from the
ordinary mechanics. Denoting the angular momentum of
the electron round the nucleus by M, we have immediately

for a circular orbit 7M = o where @ is the frequency of

revolution and T the kinetic energy of the electron; for a
circular orbit we further have T= W (see p, 3) and from (2),
p. 5, we consequently get

M="M,,

where My= j-=1:04x 10-7,
at

Tf we therefore assume that the orbit of the electron in
the stationary states is circular, the result of the calculation
on p. 5 can be expressed by the simple condition: that the
angular momentum of the electron round the nucleus in a
stationary state of the system is equal to an entire multiple
of a universal value, independent of the charge on the
nucleus. The possible importance of the angular momentum
in the discussion of atomic systems in relation to Planck’s
theory is emphasized by Nicholson *,

The great number of different stationary states we do not
observe except by investigation of the emission and absorption
of radiation. In most of the other physical phenomena,
however, we only observe the atoms of the matter ina single
distinct state, 7. e. the state of the atoms at low temperature.
From the preceding considerations we are immediately led
to the assumption that the “permanent” state is the one
among the stationary states during the formation of which
the greatest amount of energy is emilted. According to the
equation (3) on p. 5, this state is the one which corresponds
to7=1.

§ 4. Absorption of Radiation.

Tn order to account for Kirchhoff’s law it is necessary to
introduce assumptions on the mechanism of absorption of
radiation which correspond to those we have used considering
the emission, Thus we must assume that a system consisting
of a nucleus and an electron rotating round it under certain
circumstances can absorb a radiation of a frequency equal to
the frequency of the homogeneous radiation emitted during

the passing of the system between different stationary states.
Let us consider the radiation emitted during the passing of
the system between two stationary states A, and A, corre-
sponding to values for 7 equal to 7; and 7, 7; > 7;. As the
necessary condition for an emission of the radiation in question
was the presence of systems in the state A,, we must assume
that the necessary condition for an absorption of the radiation
is the presence of systems in the state A).

These considerations seem to be in conformity with expe-
riments on absorption in gases, In hydrogen gas at ordinary
conditions for instance there is no absorption of a radiation of
a frequency corresponding to the line-spectrum of this gas ;
such an absorption is only observed in hydrogen gas in
a luminous state. This is what we should expect according
to the above. We have on p. 9 assumed that the radiation
in question was emitted during the passing of the systems
between stationary states corresponding to r~2. The state

of the atoms in hydrogen gas at ordinary conditions should,
however, correspond to r=1; furthermore, hydrogen atoms
at ordinary conditions combine into molecules, i. e. into
systems in which the electrons have frequencies different
from those in the atoms (see Part III.). From the circum-
stance that certain substances in a non-luminous state, as,
for instance, sodium vapour, absorb radiation corresponding
to lines in the line-spectra of the substances, we may, on the
other hand, conclude that the lines in question are emitted
during the passing of the system between two states, one of
which is the permanent state.

How much the above considerations differ from an inter-
pretation based on the ordinary electrodynamics is perhaps
most clearly shown by the fact that we have been forced to
assume that a system of electrons will absorb a radiation of a
frequency different from the frequency of vibration of the
electrons calculated in the ordinary way. It may in this
connexion be of interest to mention a generalization of the
considerations to which we are led by experiments on the
photo-electric effect, and which may be able to throw some
light on the problem in question. Let us consider a state of
the system in which the electron is free, .e. in which the
electron possesses kinetic cnergy sufficient to remove to infinite
distances from the nucleus. If we assume that the motion of
the electron is governed by the ordinary mechanics and that
there is no (sensible) energy radiation, the total energy of
the system—as in the above considered stationary states—
will be constant. Further, there will be perfect continuity
between the two kinds of states, as the difference between

of Atoms and Molecules. qT

frequency and dimensions of the systems in successive
stationary states will diminish without limit if 7 increases.
In the following considerations we shall for the sake of
brevity refer to the two kinds of states in question as
“mechanical” states; by this notation only emphasizing:
the assumption that the motion of the electron in both cases
can be accounted for by the ordinary mechanics.

Tracing the analogy between the two kinds of mechanical
states, we might now expect the possibility of an absorption
of radiation, not only corresponding to the passing. of the
system between two different stationary states, but also
corresponding to the passing between one of the stationary
states and a state in which the electron is free ; and as above,
we might expect that the frequency of this radiation was de-
termined by the equation E=/v, where E is the difference
between the total energy of the system in the two states.
As it will be seen, such an absorption of radiation is just
what is observed in experiments on ionization by ultra-violet
light and by Réntgen rays. Obviously, we get in this way
the same expression for the kinetic energy of an electron
ejected from an atom by photo-electric effect as that deduced
by Hinstein *, i, e. T=hv— W, where T is the kinetic energy
ot the electron ejected, and W the total amount of energy
emitted during the original binding of the electron.

The above considerations may further account for the
result of some experiments of R. W. Wood f on absorption
of light by sodium vapour. In these experiments, an
absorption corresponding to a very great number of lines in
the principal series of the sodium spectrum is observed, and
in addition a continuous absorption which begins at the head
of the series and extends to the extreme ultra-violet. This
is exactly what we should expect according to the analogy in
question, and, as we shall see, a closer consideration of the
above experiments allows us to trace the analogy still
further. As mentioned on p.9 the radii of the orbits of
the electrons will for stationary states corresponding to high
values for + be very great compared with ordinary atomic
dimensions. This circumstance was used as an explanation
of the non-appearance in experiments with vacuum-tubes of
lines corresponding to the higher numbers in the Balmer
series of the hydrogen spectrum. This is also in conformity
with experiments on the emission spectrum of sodium ; in
the principal series of the emission spectrum of this substance

rather few lines are observed. Now in Wood’s experiments
the pressure was not very low, and the states corresponding
to high values for r could therefore not appear ; yet in the
absorption spectrum about 50 lines were detected. Tn the
experiments in question we consequently observe an absorption
of radiation which is not accompanied by a complete transition
between two different stationary states. According to the
present theory we must assume that this absorption is followed
by an emission of energy during which the systems pass back
to the original stationary state. If there are no collisions
between the different systems this energy will be emitted as
a radiation of the same frequency as that absorbed, and there
will be no true absorption but only a scattering of the original
radiation ; a true absorption will not oceur unless the energy
in question is transformed by coilisions into kinetic energy of
free particles. In analogy we may now from the above expe-
riments conclude that a bound electron—also in cases in which
there is no ionization—will have an absorbing (scattering)
influence on a homogeneous radiation, as soon as the fre-
quency of the radiation is greater than W/h, where W is the
total amount of energy emitted during the binding of the
electron. This would be highly in favour of a theory of
absorption as the one sketched above, as there can in sucha
case be no question of a coincidence of the frequency of the
radiation and a characteristic frequency of vibration of the
electron. It will further be seen that the assumption, that
there will be an absorption (scattering) of any radiation
corresponding to a transition between two different me-
chanical states, is in perfect analogy with the assumption
generally used that a free electron will have an absorbing
(seattering) influence on light of any frequency. Corre-
sponding considerations will hold for the emission of radiation.

In analogy to the assumption used in this paper that the
emission of line-spectra is due to the re-formation of atoms
after one or more of the lightly bound electrons are removed,
we may assume that the homogeneous Réntgen radiation is
emitted during the settling down of the systems after one of
the firmly bound electrons escapes, e.g. by impact of cathode
particles *. In the next part of this paper, dealing with the
constitution of atoms, we shall consider the question more
closely and try to show that a calculation based on this
assumption is in quantitative agreement with the results of
experiments : here we shall only mention briefly a problem
with which we meet in such a calculation.

Experiments on the phenomena of X-rays suggest that not
only the emission and absorption of radiation cannot be
treated by the help of the ordinary electrodynamics, but not
even the result of a collision between two electrons of which
the one is bound in an atom. This is perhaps most clearly
shown by some very instructive calculations on the energy
of B-particles emitted from radioactive substances recently
published by Rutherford*. These calculations strongly
suggest that an electron of great velocity in passing through
an atom and colliding with the electrons bound will loose
energy in distinct finite quanta. As is immediately seen,
this is very different from what we might expect if the result
of the collisions was governed by the usual mechanical laws.
The failure of the classical mechanics in such a problem
might also be expected beforehand from the absence of any-
thing like equipartition of kinetic energy between free
electrons and electrons bound in atoms. From the point of
view of: the “mechanical” states we sce, however, that the
following assumption—which is in accord with the above
analogy—might be able to account for the result of Ruther-
ford’s calculation and for the absence of equipuartition of
kinetic energy : two colliding electrons, bound or free, will,
after the collision as well as before, be in mechanical states.
Obviously, the introduction of such an assumption would not
make any alteration necessary in the classical treatment of a
collision between two free particles. But, considering a col-
lision between a free and a bound electron, it would follow
that the bound electron by the collision could not acquire a
less amount of energy than the difference in energy corre-
sponding to successive stationary states, and consequently
that the free electron which collides with it could not lose a
Jess amount.

The preliminary and hypothetical character of the above
considerations needs not to be emphasized. The intention,
however, has been to show that the sketched generalization
of the theory of the stationary states possibly may afford a
simple basis of representing a number of experimental facts
which cannot be explained by help of the ordinary electro-
dynamics, and that the assumptions used do not seem to be
inconsistent with experiments on phenomena for which a
satisfactory explanation has been given by the classical
dynamics and the wave theory of light.

§ 5. The permanent State of an Atomie System.

We shall now return to the main object of this paper—the
discussion of the “ permanent” state of a system consisting
of nuclei and bound electrons. For a system consisting of a
nucleus and an electron rotating round it, this state is,
according to the above, determined by the condition that the
angular momentum of the electron round the nucleus is

equal to

h
Qa

On the theory of this paper the only neutral atom which
contains a single electron is the hydrogen atom. ‘The per-
manent state of this atom should correspond to the values of
aand w calculated on p. 5. Unfortunately, however, we
know very little of the behaviour of hydrogen atoms on
account of the small dissociation of hydrogen molecules at
ordinary temperatures. In order to get a closer comparison
with experiments, it is necessary to consider more complicated
systems.

Considering systems in which more electrons are bound by
a positive nucleus, a configuration of the electrons which
presents itself as a permanent state is one in which the
electrons are arranged in a ring round the nucleus. In the
discussion of this problem on the basis of the ordinary
electrodynamics, we meet—apart from the question of the
energy radiation—with new difficulties due to the question
of the stability of the ring, Disregarding for a moment this
latter difficulty, we sball first consider the dimensions and
frequency of the systems in relation to Planck’s theory of
radiation.

Let us consider a ring consisting of n electrons rotating
round a nucleus of charge EK, the electrons being arranged
at equal angular ‘intervals around the circumference of a
circle of radius a.

The total potential energy of the system consisting of the
electrons and the nucleus is

P= - (Hes),

Denoting the kinetic energy of an electron by T and
neglecting the electromagnetic forces due to the motion of
the electrons (see Part 1I.), we get, putting the centrifugal
force on an electron equal to the radial force,

or

From this we get for the frequency of revolution

The total amount of energy W necessary transferred to the
system in order to remove the electrons to infinite distances
apart from the nucleus and from each other is

W=—P-rT= 3, B—es) = nT,

equal to the total kinetic energy of the electrons.

We sce that the only difference in the above formula and
those holding for the motion of a single electron in acircular
orbit round a nucleus is the exchange of E for H~es,. It is
also immediately seen that corresponding to the motion of an
electron in an elliptical orbit round a nucleus, there will bea
motion of the x electrons in which each rotates in an ellip-
tical orbit with the nucleus in the focus, and the n electrons
at any moment are situated at equal angular intervals on a
circle with the nucleus as the centre. The major axis and
frequency of the orbit of the single electrons will for this
motion be given by the expressions (1) on p. 3 if we

replace EB by E—es, and W. by ¥, Let us now suppose

that the system of n electrons rotating in a ring round a
nucleus is formed in a way analogous to the one assumed for
a single electron rotating round a nucleus. It will thus be
assumed that the electrons, before the binding by the nucleus,
were at a great distance apart from the latter and possessed
no sensible velocities, and also that during the binding a
homogeneous radiation is emitted. As in the case of a single
electron, we have here that the total amount of energy emitted
during the formation of the system is equal to the final kinetic
energy of the electrons. If we now suppose that during the

formation of the system the electrons at any moment are
situated at equal angular intervals on the circumference of a
circle with the nucleus in the centre, from analogy with
the considerations on p. 5 we are here led to assume the
existence of a series of stationary configurations in which

the kinetic energy per electron is equal to tho where 7 is

an entire number, 4 Planck’s constant, and » the frequency
of revolution. The configuration in which the greatest
amount of energy is emitted is, as before, the one in which
v=1. This configuration we shall assume to be the permanent
state of the system if the electrons in this state are arranged
in a single ring. As for the case of a single electron we get
that the angular momentum of each of the electrons is equal

h
to ie It may be remarked that instead of considering the

single electrons we might have considered the ring as an
entity. This would, however, lead to the samo result, for in
this case the frequency of revolution will be replaced by
the frequency nw of the radiation from the whole ring calcu~
lated from the ordinary electrodynamics, and T by the total
kinetic energy nT.

There may be many other stationary states corresponding
to other ways of forming the system. The assumption of the
existence of such states seems necessary in order to account
for the line-spectra of systems containing more than one
electron (p. 11); it is also suggested by the theory of
Nicholson mentioned on p. 6, to which we shall return in
amoment. The consideration of the spectra, however, gives,
as far as I can see, no indication of the existence of stationary
states in which all the electrons are arranged in a ring and
which correspond to greater values for the total energy
emitted than the one we above have assumed to be the
permanent state.

Further, there may be stationary configurations of a
system of x electrons and a nucleus of charge E in which all
the electrons are notarranged ina single ring. The question,
however, of the existence of such stationary configurations is
not essential for our determination of the permanent state, as
long as we assume that the electrons in this state of the
system are arranged ina singlering. Systems corresponding
to more complicated configurations will be discussed on

. 24,
P Using the relation T=h$ we get, by help of the above

expressions for T’ and @, values for a and corresponding to

the permanent state of the system which only differ from
those given by the equations (3) on p. 5, by exchange of
E for E~—esn.

The question of stability of a ring of electrons rotating
round a positive charge is discussed in great detail by Sir J.
J. Thomson *, An adaption of Thomson’s analysis for the
case here considered of a ring rotating round a nucleus of
negligibly small linear dimensions is given by Nicholson f.
The investigation of the problem in question naturally divides
in two parts: one concerning the stability for displacements
of the electrons in the plane of the ring ; one concerning
displacements perpendicular to this plane. As Nicholson’s
calculations show, the answer to the question of stability
differs very much in the two cases in question, While the
ring for the latter displacements in general is stable if the
number of electrons is not great; the ring is in no case
considered by Nicholson stable for displacements of the first
kind.

According, however, to the point of view taken in thia
paper, the question of stability for displacements of the
electrons in the plane of the ring is most intimately connected
with the question of the mechanism of the binding of the
electrons, and like the latter cannot be treated on the basis of
the ordinary dynamics. The hypothesis of which we shall
make use in the following is that the stability of a ring of
electrons rotating round a nucleus is secured through the
above condition of the universal constancy of the angular
momentum, together with the further condition that the
configuration of the particles is the one by the formation of
which the greatest amount of energy is emitted. As will be
shown, this hypothesis is, concerning the question of stability
for a displacement of the electrons perpendicular to the plane
of the ring, equivalent to that used in ordinary mechanical
calculations.

Returning to the theory of Nicholson on the origin of
lines observed in the spectrum of the solar corona, we shall
now see that the difficulties mentioned on p. 7 may be only
formal. In the first place, from the point of view considered
above the objection as to the instability of the systems for
displacements of the electrons in the plane of the ring may
not be valid. Further, the objection as to the emission of the
radiation in quanta will not have reference to the calculations
in question, if we assume that in the coronal spectrum we are
not dealing with a true emission but only with a scattering of
radiation. This assumption seems probable if we consider

the conditions in the celestial body in question; for on
account of the enormous rarefaction of the matter there may
be comparatively few collisions to disturb the stationary
states and to cause a true emission of light corresponding to
the transition between different stationary states; on the other
hand there will in the solar corona be intense illumination of
light of all frequencies which may excite the natural vibrations
of the systems in the different stationary states. If the above
assumption is correct, we immediately understand the entirely
different form for the laws connecting the lines discussed by
Nicholson and those connecting the ordinary line-spectra
considered in this paper.

Proceeding to consider systems of a more complicated
constitution, we shall make use of the following theorem,
which can be very simply proved :—

“In every system consisting of electrons and positive
nuclei, in which the nuclei are at rest and the electrons move
in. circular orbits with a velocity small compared with the
velocity of light, the kinetic energy will be numerically equal
to half the petential energy.” :

By help of this theorem we get—as in the previous cases
of a single electron or of a ring rotating round a nucleus—
that the total amount of energy emitted, by the formation of
the systems froma configuration in which the distances apart
of the particles are infinitely great and in which the particles
have no velocities relative to each other, is equal to the
kinetic energy of the electrons in the final configuration.

In analogy with ‘the case of a single ring we are here led
to assume that corresponding to any configuration of equili-
brium a series of geometrically similar, stationary con-
figurations of the system will exist in which the kinetic
energy of every electron is equal to the frequency of revo-

lution multiplied by 5h where 7 is an entire number and h

Planck’s constant. In any such series of stationary con-
figurations the one corresponding to the greatest amount of
energy emitted will be the one in which + for every electron
is equal to 1. Considering that the ratio of kinetic energy
to frequency for a particle rotating in a circular orbit is
equal to a times the angular momentum round the centre of
the orbit, we are therefore led to the following simple
generalization of the hypotheses mentioned on pp. 15 and 22.

“In any molecular system consisting af positive nuclei and
electrons in which the nuclei are at rest relative to each other
and the electrons move in circular orbits, the angular momentum

of every electron round the centre of its orbit will in the

permanent state of the system be equal to fo where h is
Planck’s constant” *. 7

In analogy with the considerations on p. 23, we shall
assume that a configuration satisfying this condition is stable
if the total energy of the system is less than in any neigh-
bouring configuration satisfying the same condition of the
angular momentum of the electrons.

As mentioned in the introduction, the above hypothesis will
be used in a following communication as a basis for a theory of
the constitution of atoms and molecules. It will be shown
that it leads to results which seem to bo in conformity with
experiments on a number of different phenomena.

The foundation of the hypothesis has been sought entirely
in its relation with Planck’s theory of radiation ; by help of
considerations given later it will be attempted to throw
some further light on the foundation of it from another
point of view,

[Plates I. & IL J

Part I,

Rmsons have been given that make it seem very

probable that the atoms are constituted, as suggested
by Sir J. J. Thomson, of masses of positive electrification
within which ‘negative electrons are revolving. The elec-
trons take positions of dynamical equilibrium due to their
mutual action upon each other, and upon the positive
electricity. The present investigation aims, first, to obtain
more exact information concerning these atoms themselves,
and, second, to examine the manner in which two or more
such atoms, either of the same or of different kinds, must
act upon each other when brought, within molecular range.
To anticipate the results which are later described it is found
that such atoms come to definite positions of stable equilibrium

* In the considerations leading to this hypothesis we have assumed
that the velocity of the electrons is small compared with the velocity of
