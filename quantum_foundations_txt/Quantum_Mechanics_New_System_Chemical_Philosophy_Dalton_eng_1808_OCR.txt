PREFACE,

Ir was the author’s intention when this work was put
to press to publish it entire in one volume ; but he is
now induced to publish it in two parts, for reasons
which it may be proper to announce.

Various essays of his were read before the Literary
and Philosophical Society of Manchester, chiefly on
heat and elastic fluids, and were published in the 5th
Volume of their Memoirs, in 1802, The new views
which these essays developed, were considered both
curious and important. The essays were republished
in several Philosophical Journals, and soon after
translated into French and German, and circulated
abroad through the medium of the foreign Journals.
The author was not remiss in prosecuting his researches,
in which he was considerably assisted by the applica-
tion of principles derived from the above essays. In
1803, he was gradually ted to those primary Laws,
which seem to obtain in regard to heat, and to chemi-
cal combinations, and which it is the object of the
present work to exhibit and elucidate. A brief outline
of them was first publicly given the ensuing winter in
acourse of Lectures on Natural Philosophy, at the
Royal Institution in London, and was left for publica-
tion in the Journals of the Institution; but he is not
informed whether that was done. The author has
ever since been occasionally urged by several of his
philosophical friends to lose no time in communicating
the results of his enquiries to the public, alledging, that
the interests of science, and his own reputation, might

--- Page 10 ---
vie PREFACE,

suffer by delay. In the spring of 1807, he was induced
to offer the exposition of the principles herein contained
in a course of Lectures, which were twice read in
Edinburgh, and once in Glasgow. On these occasions
he was honoured with the attention of gentlemen,
universally acknowledged to be of the first respectability
for their scientific attainments: most of whom were
pleased to express their desire to see the publication of
the doctrine in the present form, as soon as convenient.
Upon the author’s return to Manchester he began to
prepare for the press. Several experiments required to be
repeated; other new ones were to be made; almost
the whole system both in matter and manner was to be
new, and consequently required more time for the
composition and arrangement. These considerations,
together with the daily avocations of profession, have
delayed the work nearly a year; and, judging from the
past, it may require another year before it can be com-
pleted. In the mean time, as the doctrine of heat, and
the general principles of Chemical Synthesis, are in a
good degree independent of the future details, there
can no great detriment arise to the author, or incon-
venience to his readers, in submitting what is already
prepared, to the inspection of the public.

CHAP. I.

ON HEAT OR CALORIC.

Tue most probable opinion concerning the
nature of caloric, is, that of its being an elas-
tic fluid of great subtilty, the particles of
which repel one another, but are attracted by
all other bodies.

When all surrounding bodies are of one
temperature, then the heat attached to them
is in a quiescent state ; the absolute quantities
of heat in any two bodies in this case are not
equal, whether we take the bodies of equal
weights or of equal bulks. Each kind of
matter has its peculiar affinity for heat, by
which it requires a certain portion of the fluid,
in order to be in equilibrium with other bodies
at a certain temperature. Were the whole

--- Page 14 ---
g ON HEAT OR CALORIC.

quantities of heat in bodies of equal weight or
bulk, or even the relative quantities, accu-
rately ascertained, for any temperature, the
numbers expressing those quantities would
constitute a table of specific heats, analogous
toa table of specific gravities, and would be
an important acquisition toscience. Attempts
of this kind have been made with very con-
siderable success.

Whether the specific heats, could they be
thus obtained for one temperature, would ex-
press the relation at evety other temperature,
whilst the bodies retained their form, is an
enquiry of some moment. From the experi-
ments hitherto made there seems little doubt of
its being nearly so; but it is perhaps more cor-
rect to deduce the specific heat of bodies from
equal bulks than from equal weights. It is very
certain that the two methods will not give pre-
cisely the same results, because the expansions
of different bodies by equal increments of
temperature are not the same. But before this
subject can well be considered, we should first
settle what is intended to be meant by the word
temperature.

--- Page 15 ---
ON TEMPERATURE. 3

SECTION 1.

ON TEMPERATURE,

And the Instruments for measuring it.

The notion of the specific heat of bodies
and of temperature, may be well conceived
from a system of cylindrical vessels of different
diameters connected with each other by pipes
at the bottom, and a small cylindrical tube
attached to the system, all capable of holding
water or any other liquid, and placed per-
pendicular to the horizon. (See Plate 1. Fig. 1.)
The cylinders are to represent the different
specific heats of bodies; and the small tube,
being divided into equal parts, is to represent
the thermometer or measure of temperature.
If water be poured into one vessel it rises to
the same level in them all, and in the thermo-
meter ; if equal portions be successively poured
in, there will be equal rises in the vessels and
in the tube; the water is obviously intended
to represent heat or caloric. According to this
notion, then, it is evident that equal incre-
ments of heat in any body correspond to equal
increments of temperature.

This view of the subject necessarily requires,
that if two bodies be taken of any one tempe-

--- Page 16 ---
4 ON TEMPERATURE.

rature, and then be raised to any other tem-
perature, the additional quantities of heat
received by each will be exactly proportioned
to the whole quantities of that fluid previously
contained in them. ‘This conclusion, though
it may be nearly consistent with facts in gene-
ral, is certainly not strictly true. For, in
elastic fluids, it is well known, an increase of
bulk occasions an increase of specific heat,
though the weight and temperature continue
the same. It is probable then that solids and
liquids too, as they increase in bulk by heat,
increase in their capacity or capability of re-
ceiving more. This circumstance, however,
might not affect the conclusion above, pro-
vided all bodies increased in one and the same
proportion by heat ; but as this is not the case,
the objection to the conclusion appears of va-
lidity. Suppose it were allowed that a ther-
mometer ought to indicate the accession of
equal increments of the fluid denominated
caloric, to the body of which it was to shew
the temperature ;—suppose too that a measure
of air or elastic fluid was to be the body; query,
whether ought the air to be suffered to expand
by the temperature, or to be confined tothesame
space of one measure? It appears to me the
most likely in theory to procure a standard
capacity for heat by subjecting a body to heat,

--- Page 17 ---
ON TEMPERATURE. 5

whilst its bulk is kept constantly the same. Let
m == the quantity of heat necessary to raise the
elastic fluid 10° in temperature in this case ;
then m +d =the quantity necessary to raise
the same 10°, when suffered to expand, d being
the difference of the absolute quantities of heat
contained by the body in the two cases. Now,
zis m = the quantity of heat necessary to raise
the temperature 1° in the first case; but
yx (m+d) can not be the quantity necessary in
the second case; it will be a less quantity in
the lower degrees, and a greater in the higher.
If these principles be admitted, they may be
applied to liquids and solids; a liquid, as wa-
ter, cannot be raised in temperature equally by
equal increments of heat, unless it is confined
within the same space by an extraordinary and
perhaps incalculable force ; if we suffer it to
take its ordinary course of expansion, then,
not equal, but increasing increments of heat
will raise its temperature uniformly. If suffi-
cient force were applied to condense a liquid
or solid, there can be no doubt but heat would
be given out, as with elastic fluids.

Tt may perhaps be urged by some that the
difference of heat in condensed and rarefied
air, and by analogy probably in the supposed
cases of liquids and solids, is too small to have
sensible influence on the capacities or affinities

--- Page 18 ---
6 ON TEMPERATURE.

of bodies for heat ; that the effects are such,
as only to raise or depress the temperature a
few degrees; when perhaps the whole mass
of heat is equivalent to two or three thousand
such degrees; and that a volume of air sup-
posed to contain 2005° of temperature being
rarefied till it become 2000°, or lost 5° of tem-
perature, may still be considered as having its
capacity invariable. This may be granted if
the data are admissible ; but the true changes
of temperature consequent to the condensation
and rarefaction of air have never been deter-
mined. I have shewn, (Manchester Mem.
Vol. 5, Pt. 2.) that in the process of admit-
ting air into a vacuum, and of liberating
condensed air, the inclosed thermometer is
affected as if in a medium of 50° higher or
lower temperature ; but the effects of instan-
taneously doubling the density of air, or re-
plenishing a vacuum, cannot easily be derived
from those or any other facts I am acquainted
with ; they may perhaps raise the temperature
one hundred degrees or more. The great heat
produced in charging an air-gun is a proof of a
great change of capacity in the inclosed air.—
Upon the whole then it may be concluded,
that the change of bulk in the same body by
change of temperature, is productive of con-
siderable effect on its capacity for heat, but

--- Page 19 ---
ON TEMPERATURE. 7

that we are not yet in possession of data to
determine its effect on elastic fluids, and still
Jess on liquids and solids, M.De Luc found,
that in mixing equal weights of water at the
freezing and boiling temperatures, 32° and 212°,
the mixture indicated nearly 119° of Fahren-
heit’s mercurial thermometer; but the numerical
mean is 122°; if he had mixed egual bulks of
water at 32° and 212°, he would have found a
mean of 115°. Now the means determined by
experiment in both these ways are probably
too high ; for, water of these two temperatures
being mixed, loses about 1-90th of its bulk ;
this condensation of volume (whether arising
from an increased affinity of aggregation, or
the effect of external mechanical compression,
is all one) must expel a quantity of heat, and
raise the temperature above the true mean.
It is not improbable that the true mean tem-
perature between 32° and 212° may be as low
as 110° of Fahrenheit.

It has been generally admitted that if two
portions of any liquid, of equal weight but
of different temperatures, be mixed together,
the mixture must indicate the true mean tem-
perature ; and that instrument which corres-
ponds with it is an accurate measure of tem-
perature. But if the preceding observations
be correct, it may be questioned whether any

--- Page 20 ---
8 ON TEMPERATURE.

two liquids will agree in giving the same mean
temperature upon being mixed as above.

In the present imperfect mode of estimating
temperature, the equable expansion of mer-
cury is adopted as a scale for its measure.
This cannot be correct for two reasons; Ist.
the mixture of water of different temperatures
is always below the mean by the mercurial
thermometer ; for instance, water of 32° and
212° being mixed, gives 119° by the thermo-
meter ; whereas it appears from the preceding
remarks, that the temperature of such mixture
ought to be found above the mean 122°; 2d.
mercury appears by the most recent experi-
ments to expand by the same law as water;
namely, as the square of the temperature from
the point of greatest density —The apparently
equal expansion of mercury arises from our
taking a small portion of the scale of expan-
sion, and that at some distance from the free-
zing point of the liquid.

From what has been remarked it appears
that we have not yet any mode easily practi-
cable for ascertaining what is the true mean
between any two temperatures, as those of
freezing and boiling water; nor any thermo-
meter which can be considered as approxima-
ting nearly to accuracy.

Heat is a very important agent in nature ; it

--- Page 21 ---
ON TEMPERATURE. 9

cannot be doubted that so active a principle
must be subject to general laws. If the phe-
nomena indicate otherwise, it is because we
do not take a sufficiently comprehensive view
of them. Philosophers have sought, but in
vain, for a body that should expand uniformly,
or in arithmetical progression, by equal incre-
ments of heat; liquids have been tried, and
found to expand unequally, all of them ex-
panding more in the higher temperatures than
in the lower, but no two exactly alike. Mer-
cury has appeared to have the least variation,
or approach nearest to uniform expansion, and
on that and other accounts has been generally
preferred in the construction of thermometers.
Water has been rejected, as the most unequally
expanding liquid yet known. Since the publi-
cation of my experiments on the expansion of
elastic fluids by heat, and those of Gay Lussac,
immediately succeeding them, both demon-
strating the perfect sameness in all permanently
elastic fluids in this respect ; it has been ima-
gined by some that gases expand equally ; but
this is not corroborated by experience from
other sources,

Some time ago it occurred to me as probable,
that water and mercury, notwithstanding their
apparent diversity, actually expand by the
same law, and that the quantity of expansion

--- Page 22 ---
10 ON TEMPERATURE.

is as the square of the temperature from their
respective freezing points. Water yery nearly
accords with this law according to the present
scale of temperature, and the little deviation
observable is exactly of the sort that ought
to exist, from the known error of the equal
division of the mercurial scale. By prosecut-
ing this enquiry I found that the mercurial
and water scales divided according to the prin-
ciple just mentioned, would perfectly accord,
as far as they were comparable ; and that the
law will probably extend to all other pure
liquids ; but not to heterogeneous compounds,
as liquid solutions of salts.

If the law of the expansion of liquids be such
as just mentioned, it is natural to expect that
other phenomena of heat will be characteristic
of the same law. It may be seen in my Essay
on the Force of Steam (Man. Mem. Vol. 5,
Part 2.) that the elastic force or tension of
steam in contact with water, increases nearly
in a geometrical progression to equal incre-
ments of temperature, as measured by the com-
mon mercurial scale ; it was not a little sur-
prising to me at the time to find such an ap-
proach to a regular progression, and I was then
inclined to think, that the want of perfect
coincidence was owing to inaccuracy in the
division of the received thermometer; but

--- Page 23 ---
ON TEMPERATURE. il

overawed by the authority of Crawford, who
seemed to have proved past doubt that the error
of the thermometer no where amounted to
more than one or two degrees, I durst not
venture to throw out more than a suspicion at
the conclusion of the essay, on the expansion
of elastic fluids by heat, that the error was
probably 3 or 4°, as De Luc had determined ;
to admit of an error in the supposed mean,
amounting to 12°, seemed unwarrantable. How-
ever it now appears that the force of steam in
contact with water, increases accurately in
geometrical progression to equal increments of
temperaturé, provided those increments are
measured by a thermometer of water or mer,
cury, the scales of which are divided accord-
ing to the above-mentioned law.

The Force of Steam having been found to
vary by the above law, it was natural to ex-
pect that of air to do the same; for, air
(meaning any permanently elastic fluid) and
steam are essentially the same, differing only
in certain modifications. Accordingly it was
found upon trial that air expands in geometri-
cal progression to equal increments of tempe-
rature, measured as above. Steam detached
from water, by which it is rendered incapable
of increase or diminution in quantity, was found
by Gay Lussac, to have the same quantity of

--- Page 24 ---
12 ON TEMPERATURE,

expansion as the permanently elastic fluids.
I had formerly conjectured that air expands
as the crbe of the temperature from absolute
privation, as hinted in the essay above-men-
tioned; but I am now obliged to abandon
that conjecture.

The union of so many analogies in favour
the preceding hypothesis of temperature is
almost sufficient to establish it; but one remark-
able trait of temperature derived from expe-
riments on the heating and cooling of bodies,
which does not accord with the received scale,
and which, nevertheless, claims special con-
sideration, is, that @ body in cooling loses heat
in proportion lo its excess of temperature above
that of the cooling medium ; or that the tem-
perature descends in geometrical progression
in equal moments of time. Thus if a body
were 1000°above the medium; the times in cool-
ing from 1000? to 100, from 100 to 10,and from
10 to 1°, ought all to be the same, This,
though nearly, is not accurately true, if we
adopt the common scale, as is well known 3
the times in the lower intervals of temperature
are found longer than in the upper; but the new
scale proposed, by shortening the lower de-
grees, and lengthening the higher, is found
perfectly according to this remarkable law of
heat.

--- Page 25 ---
ON TEMPERATURE. 13,

Temperature then will be found to have four
most remarkable analogies to support it.

Ist. All pure homogenous liquids, as water
and mercury, expand from the point of their
congelation, or greatest density, a quantity
always as the square of the temperature from
that point.

2. The force of steam from pure liquids,
as water, ether, &c. constitutes a geometrical
progression to increments of temperature in
arithmetical progression.

3. The expansion of permanent elastic
fluids is in geometrical progression to equal
increments of temperature.

4, The refrigeration of bodies is in geo-
metrical progression in equal increments of
time.

A mercurial thermometer graduated accord-
ing to this principle will differ from the ordi-
nary one with equidifferential scale, by having
its lower degrees smaller and the upper ones
larger; the mean between freezing and
boiling water, or 122° on the new scale, will
be found about 110°on the old one.—The
following Table exhibits the numerical calcu-
lations illustrative of the principles inculcated
above.

ON TEMPERATURE. 15

Explanation of the Table.

The first column contains the degrees of
temperature, of which there are supposed to
be 180 between freezing and boiling water,
according to Fahrenheit. The concurrence
of so many analogies as have been mentioned,
as well as experience, indicate that those de-
grees are produced by equal increments of
the matter of heat, or caloric; but then it
should be understood they are to be applied
to a body of uniform bulk and capacity, such
as air confined within a given space. If
water, for instance,-in its ordinary state, is to
be raised successively through equal intervals of
temperature, as measured by this scale, then
unequal increments of heat will be requisite,
by reason of its increased capacity. The first
number in the column, —175°, denotes the
point at which mercury freezes, hitherto mark-
ed —40°, The calculations are made for every
10° from —68° to 212°; above the last num-
ber, for every 100°, By comparing this column
with the 5th, the correspondences of the new
scale and the common one are perceived: the
greatest difference between $2° and 212° is
observable at 122° of the new scale, which
agrees with 110° of the old, the difference

--- Page 28 ---
16 ON TEMPERATURE,

being 12°; but below 32° and above 212°, the
differences become more remarkable,

The 2d and 3d columns are two series, the
one of roots, and the other of their squares.
They are obtained thus ; opposite 32°, in the
first column, is placed in the 3d, 72°, being
the number of degrees or equal parts in Fahren-
heit’s scale from freezing mercury to freezing
water; and opposite 212° in the first is placed
252°1n the 3d, being 212 + 40°, the number
of degrees (or rather equal parts) between
freezing mercury and boiling water. The
square roots of these two numbers, 72° and
252°, are found and placed opposite to them
in the second column. The number 8.4853
represents the relative quantity of real tem-
perature between freezing mercury and free-
zing water; and the number 15.8743 repre-
sents the like between freezing mercury and
boiling water ; consequently the difference
7.3890 represents the relative quantity between
freezing water and boiling water, and 7.3890
+ 18= .4105 represents the quantity corres-
ponding to each interval of 10°. By adding
-4105 successively to 8.4853, or subtracting it
from it, the rest of the numbers in the column
are obtained, which are of course in arithme-
tical progression. The numbers in the 3d
column are all obtained by squaring those of

--- Page 29 ---
ON TEMPERATURE. VW

the 2d opposite to them. The unequal dif
ferences in the 3d column mark the expansions
of mercury due to equal increments of tem-
perature, by the theory. The inconvenient
length of the table prevents its being carried
down by intervals of 10° to the point of free-
zing mercury, which however is found to be
ele =a

The 4th column is the same as the 3d, with
the difference of 40°, to make it conform to
the common method of numbering on Vahren-
heit’s scale.

The 5th column is the 4th corrected, on
account of the unequal expansion of Glass :—
The apparent expansion of mercury in glass
is less than the real, by the expansion of the
glass itself; this, however, would not disturb the
Jaw of expansion of the liquid, both apparent
and real being subject to the same, provided
the glass expands equally ; this will be shewn
hereafter. But it has been shewn by De
Luc, that glass expands less in the lower
half of the scale than the higher; this must
occasion the mercury apparently to expand
more in the lower half than what is dictated
by the law of expansion. By calculating
from De Luc’s data, I find, that the mercury
in the middle of the scale, or 122°, ought to be
found nearly 3° higher than would be, were it

not for this increase. Not however to over-rate
the effect, I have taken it only at 1°.7, making
the number 108°, 3 in the 4th column, 110°
in the 5th, and the rest of the column is cor-
rected accordingly. The numbers in this
column cannot well be extended much beyond
the interval from freezing to boiling water, for
want of experiments on the expansion of glass.
By viewing this column along with the ist, the
quantity of the supposed error in the common
scale may be perceived ; and any observations
on the old thermometer may be reduced to
the new.

The 6th column contains the squares of the
natural series 1, 2, 3, &c. representing the
expansion of water by equal intervals of tem-
perature. This, if a portion of water at
42° expands a quantity represented by 289, at
the boiling temperature, then at 52° it will be
found to have expanded 1, at 62°, 4 parts, 8c.
&c. Water expands by cold or the abstrac-
tion of heat in the same way below the point
of greatest density, as will be illustrated when
we come to consider the absolute expansion of
bodies. The apparent greatest density too
does not happen at 39°,3 old scale ; but about
42°; and the greatest real density is at or near
36° of the same.

The 7th column contains a series of num-

bers in Geometrical Progression, denoting the
expansion of air, or elastic fluids. The volume
at 32° istaken 1000, and at 212°, 1976 accord-
ing to Gay Lussac’s and my own experiments.
As for the expansion at intermediate degrees,
General Roi makes the temperature at mid-
way of total expansion, 116°; old scale ; from
the results of my former experiments, (Manch.
Mem. Vol. 5, Part 2, page 599) the tem-
perature may be estimated at 119°; ; but I had
not then an opportunity of having air at 32°,
By more recent experiments I am convinced.
that dry air of $2° will expand the same quan-
tity from that to 117° or 118° of common scale,
as from the last term to 212°. According to
the theory in the above Table it appears, that
air of 117° will be 1188, or have acquired one
halfits total expansion. Now if the theory ac-
cord so well with experiment in the middle of
the interval, we cannot expect it to do other-
wise in the intermediate points.

The 8th column contains the force of aque-
ous vapours in contact with water expressed
in inches of mercury, at the respective tem-
peratures. It constitutes a geometrical pro-
gression ; the numbers opposite 32° and 212°,
namely, .200 and 30.0 are derived from ex-
periments, (ibid. page 559) and the rest are
determined from theory. It is remarkable that

--- Page 32 ---
20 ON TEMPERATURE,

those numbers do not differ from the table
just referred to, which was the result of ac-
tual experience, so much as 2° in any part; a
difference that might even exist between two
thermometers of the same kind.

The 9th column exhibits the force of the
vapour of sulphuric ether in contact with
liquid ether; which is a geometrical progres-
sion, having a less ratio than that of water.
Since writing my former Essay on the Force
of Steam, I am enabled to correct one of the
conclusions therein contained; the error was
committed by trusting to the accuracy of the
common mercurial thermometer. Experience
confirmed me that the force of vapour from
water of nearly 212°, varied from a change of
temperature as much as vapour from ether of
nearly 100°. Hence I deduced this general
law, namely, “that the variation of the force
of vapour from all liquids is the same for the
same variation of temperature, reckoning from
yapour of any given force.’—But I now find
that 30° of temperature in the lower part of
the common scale is much more than 30° in
the higher: and therefore the vapours of ether
and water are not subject to the same change
of force by equal increments of temperature.
The truth is, vapour from water, ether and
other liquids, increases in force in geometri-

--- Page 33 ---
ON TEMPERATURE. 2t

eal progression to the temperature; but the
ratio is different in different fluids. Ether as
manufactured in the large way, appears to be
2 very homogeneous liquid. I have purchased
it in London, Edinburgh, Glasgow and Man-
chester, at very different times, of precisely the
same quality in respect to its vapour; namely,
such as when thrown up into a barometer
would depress the mercury 15 inches at the
temperature of 68°. Nor does it lose any of
its effect by time; I have now a barometer
with a few drops of ether on the mercury, that
has continued with invaried efficacy for eight
or nine years. The numbers in the column
between the temperatures of 20° and 80°, are
the results of repeated observations on the
above ether barometer for many years; those
above and below are obtained from direct
experiment as far as from O to 212°; the low
ones were found by subjecting the vacuum of
the barometer to an artificial cold mixture ;
and the higher ones were found in the manner
related in my former Essays: only the highest
force has been considerably increased from
what I formerly had it, in consequence of
supplying the manometer with more ether;
it having been found to leave little or no liquid
when at the temperature of 212°; and in order
to obtain the maximum effect it is indispen-

sible to have a portion of liquid remaining
in contact with the vapour.

The 10th column shews the force of va-
pour from alcohol, or rather common spirit of
wine, determined by experiment in the same
way as the vapour of water. This is not a
geometrical progression, probably because the
liquid is not pure and homogeneous. I sus-
pect the elastic fluid in this case is a mixture
of aqueous and alcoholic vapour.

SECTION 2.

EXPANSION BY HEAT.

One important effect of heat is the expan-
sion of bodies of every kind. Solids are least
expanded; liquids more; and elastic fluids
most of all. The quantities of increase in
bulk have in many instances been determined ;
but partly through the want of a proper ther-
mometer, little general information has been
derived from particular experiments. The
force necessary to counteract the expansion
has not been ascertained, except in the case
of elastic fluids; but there is no doubt it is
very great. The quantity and law of expan-
sion of all permanent elastic fluids have already

--- Page 35 ---
ON EXPANSION. 23

been given; it remains then to advert to liquid
and solid bodies.

In order to understand the expansion of
liquids, it is expedient to premise certain
propositions :

1st. Suppose a thermometrical vessel of glass,
metal, &c., were filled with any liquid up to
acertain mark in the stem; and that it was
known the vessel and the liquid had precisely
the same expansion, bulk for bulk, with the
same change of temperature ; then it must be
evident upon a little consideration, that what-
ever change of temperature took place, the
liquid must remain at the same mark.

2. Suppose as before, except that both
bodies expand uniformly with the tempera-
ture, but the liquid at a greater rate than the
vessel: then it is evident by an increase of
temperature, the liquid would appear to ascend
uniformly a quantity equal to the difference
of the absolute expansion of the two bodies.

3. Suppose as in the last case, but that the li-
quid expands at a less rate than the vessel; the
liquid would then descend, and that uniformly
by an increase of temperature, a quantity equal
to the difference of the absolute expansions.

4. Suppose as before, only the vessel now
expands uniformly, and the liquid with a ve-
locity uniformly accelerated, commencing from

--- Page 36 ---
24 ON EXPANSION.

rest; in this case if temperature be added
uniformly, the liquid will appear to descend
with a velocity uniformly retarded to a certain
point, there to be stationary, and afterwards to
ascend with an uniformly accelerated velocity,
of the same sort as the former.— For, as
the velocity with which the liquid expands is
uniforntly accelerative, it must successively pass
through all degrees from O to any assigned
quantity, and must therefore in some mo-
ment be the same as that of the vessel, and
therefore, for that moment, the liquid must ap-
pear stationary: previously to that time the
liquid must have descended by the third pro-
position, and must afterwards ascend, by the
2d. but not uniformly. Let the absolute
space expanded by the liquid at the moment
of equal velocities be denoted by 1, then that
of the vessel in the same time must be 2; be-
cause the velocity acquired by an uniformly
accelerating force, is such as to move a body
through twice the space in the same time. It
follows then that the liquid must have sunk
1, being the excess of the expansion of the
vessel above that of the liquid. Again, let
another portion of temperature equal to the
former be added, then the absolute expansion
of the liquid will be 4, reckoned from the com-
mencement; and the expansion of the vessel

--- Page 37 ---
ae

ON EXPANSION. g3

also 4: the place of the liquid will be the same
as at first, and therefore it must apparently
ascend 1 by the 2d portion. Let a third por-
tion of heat equal to one of the former be
added, and it will make the total expansion
of the liquid 9, or give 5 additional expan-
sion, from which deducting 2, that of the
vessel, there remains 3 for the apparent ex-
pansion by the 3d portion; in like manner 5
will be due for the 4th, and 7 for the 5th, &c.,
being the series of odd numbers. But the
aggregate of these forms a series of squares,
as is well known. Hence the apparent expan-
sion will proceed by the same law as the real,
only starting from a higher temperature. If
the law of expansion of the liquid be such
that either the addition or abstraction of tem-
perature, that is, either heat or cold produces
expansion alike, reckoned from the point of
greatest density ; then the apparent expansion
will still be guided by the same law as the
real. For, if when the liquid is at the lowest
point of the scale, we withdraw a portion of
heat, it ascends to 1; or is in the circumstance
of greatest density, and no expansion as at
the commencement; if then we withdraw
another portion, it will expand 1 by hypothe-
sis, but the vessel will contract 2, which must
make the apparent expansion of the liquid 3 ;

--- Page 38 ---
26 ON EXPANSION.

by another portion it will be 5, by another 7,
&c., as before.

The truth of the above proposition may be
otherwise shewn thus :

Let 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, &c., represent the ab-
solute expansions of the liquid, and p, 2 p,
3p, 4p, 5p, &c., those of the vessel by
equal increments of temperature, then 1—p,
4—2 p, 9—3 p, 16—4 p, 25—5 p, &c., will
represent the apparent expansion of the li-
quid; the differences of these last quantities,
namely 3—p, 5—p, 7—p, 9—p, &c., form
a series in arithmetical progression, the com-
mon difference of which is 2. But it is de-
monstrated by algebraists, that the differences
of a series of square numbers, whose roots are
in arithmetical progression, form an arithme-
tical progression, and that the common differ-
ence of the terms of this progression is equal
to twice the square of the difference of the
roots. Hence, as 2 = twice the square of 1,
we have the above arithmetical series 3—p,
5—p, &c., equal to the differences of a series
of squares, the common difference of the roots
of which is 1.

Now to apply these principles: solid bodies
are generally allowed to expand uniformly
within the common range of temperature: at
ail events the quantity is so small compared

--- Page 39 ---
ON EXPANSION. 27

with the expansion of liquids, such as water,that
the deviation from uniformity cannot require
notice in many cases. Water being supposed
to expand according to the square of the tem-
perature from that of greatest density, we may
derive the following conclusions.

Cor. 1. The laws of uniformly accele-
rated motion, are the same as those of the
expansion of water, whether absolute or appa-
rent, the time in one denoting the temperature
in the other, and the space denoting the ex-
pansion: that is, if ¢ = time or temperature,
v= velocity, and s = space or expansion:
then,

7, or tv, or v? are as s.
tiv=s
visast
SisasQet
sisas t, i being supposed constant, &c.

Cor. 2. The real expansion of water
from maximum density for any number of de-
grees of temperature, is the same as the ap-
parent expansion from apparent greatest den-
sity in any vessel for the same number of
degrees. For instance, if water in a glass
vessel appears to be of greatest density, or
descends lowest at 42° of common scale, and ap-
pears to expand 2‘ of its first volume from thence

--- Page 40 ---
28 ON EXPANSION.

to 212°; then it may be inferred that the real
expansion of water from greatest density by
170° is ;' of its volume ; so that the absolute
expansion of water is determinable this way,
without knowing either at what temperature
its density is greatest, or the expansion of the
vessel containing it.

Cor. 3. If the expansion of any vessel
can be obtained; then may the temperature
at which water is of greatest density be ob-
tained; and vice versd. This furnishes us
with an excellent method of ascertaining both
the relative and absolute expansion of all
solid bodies that can be formed into vessels
cupable of holding water.

Cor. 4. If the apparent expansion of water
from maximum density for 180° were: to be
equalled by a body expanding uniformly, its
velocity must be equal to that of water at 90°,
or mid-way.—And if any solid body be found
to have the same expansion as water at 10°
from max. density ; then its expansion for 180°
must be + of that of water, &c. Because in
water v is ast, &c.

By graduating several glass thermometer
vessels, filling them with water, exposing
them to different temperatures, and comparing
results, Ihave found the apparent expansion
of water in glass for every 10° of the common

Tn the Edinburgh Philosophical Transactions

--- Page 42 ---
$0 ON EXPANSION.

for 1804, Dr. Hope has given a paper on the
contraction of water by heat in low tempera-
tures. (See also Nicholson’s Journal, Vol. 12.)
In this paper we find an excellent history of
facts and opinions relative to this remarkable
question in physics, with original experiments.
There appear to have been two opinions res-
pecting the temperature at which water obtains
its maximum density; the one stating it to
be at the freezing point, or 32°; the other at
40°. Previously to the publication of the above
essay, I had embraced the opinion that the
point was 32°, chiefly from some cxperiments
about to be related. Dr. Hope argued from
his own experiments in favour of the other
opinion. My attention was again turned
to the subject, and upon re-examination
of facts, I found them all to concur in giving
the point of greatest density at the temperature
36°, or mid-way between the points formerly
supposed. In two letters inserted in Nichol-
son’s Journal, Vol. 13 and 14, I endeavour-
ed to shew that Dr. Hope’s experiments
supported this conclusion and no other. I
shall now shew that my own experiments on
the apparent expansion of water in different
yessels, coincide with them in establishing the
same conclusion.

The results of my experiments, without

--- Page 43 ---
ON EXPANSION. SL

those deductions, were published in Nichol-
son’s Journal, Vol. 10. Since then some small
additions and corrections have been made.
Tt may be observed that small vessels, capable
of holding one or two ounces of water, were
made of the different materials, and such as
that glass tubes could be cemented into them
when full of water, so as to resemble and act
as a common thermometer. ‘The observations

As the expansion of earthen ware by heat
has never before been ascertained, we cannot
make use of the first and second experiments
to find the temperature of greatest density ; all
that we can learn from them is, that the point
must be below 38°.

According to Smeaton, glass expands +y'c5
in length for 180° of temperature ; consequent-
ly it expands ,3, inbulk. But water expands

32 ON EXPANSION.

2%+ orrather more than 18 times as much;
therefore the mean velocity of the expansion
of water (which is that at 90°, or half way) is
18 times more than that of glass, which is
equal to the expansion of water at 42°; this
last must therefore be 4, of the former; con-
sequently water of 42° has passed through
vy of the temperature to the mean, or +, of
90° = 5°, of new scale = 4° of old scale, above
the temperature at which it is absolutely of
greatest density. This conclusion however
cannot be accurate ; for, it appears from the
preceding paragraph that the temperature
must be below 38°. The inaccuracy arises, I
have no doubt, from the expansion of glass
having been under-rated by Smeaton ; not from
any mistake of his, but from the peculiar
nature of glass. Rods and tubes of glass are
seldom if ever properly annealed ; hence they
are in a state of violent energy, and often
break spontaneously or with a slight scratch
of a file: tubes have been found to expand
more than rods, and it might be expected that
thin bulbs should expand more still, because
they do not require annealing ; hence too the
great strength of thin glass, its being less brit-
tle, and more susceptible of sudden transitions
of temperature. [rom the above experiments
it seems that the expansion due to glass, such

--- Page 45 ---
ON EXPANSION. $3

as the bulbs of ordinary thermometers, is very
little less than that of iron.

Tron expands nearly 55 in length by 180°
of heat, or gi; in bulk; this is nearly ,, of
the expansion of water; hence 90 + 12 = 7°5
of true mean temperature = 6° of common
scale; this taken from 42°+4, leaves 36° of
common scale for the temperature at which
water is of greatest density.

Copper is to iron as 3:2 in expansion;
therefore if 6° be the allowance for iron, that
for copper must be 9°; hence 45°— 9° = 36°,
for the temperature as before.

Brass expands about x’; more than copper;
hence we shall have 45° — 9°! = 36°, for the
temperature as above.

Fine pewter is to iron as 11 : 6 in expan-
sion, according to Smeaton; hence 46° —
11° = 35°, for the temperature as derived from
the vessel of pewter: but this being a mixed
metal, it is not so much to be relied upon.

Zine expands rfz in bulk for 180°, if we
may credit Smeaton : hence water expands 5;
times as much as zinc ; and 90 + 54 = 17° of
new scale = 13° of oldscale ; whence 48° —
18°: = 34°! for the temperature derived from
zinc. It seems highly probable that in this
case the expansion of the vessel is over-rated ;
it was found to be less than that of lead,

--- Page 46 ---
34 ON EXPANSION.

whereas Smeaton makes it more. The vessel
was made of the patent malleable zinc of Hod-
son and Sytvester. Perhaps it contains a por-
tion of tin, which will account for the devia-
tion.

Lead expands ,1, of its bulk for 180°;
water therefore expands about 53 times as
much ; this gives 90 + 5! = 16°! of new scale
= 18° of oldscale ; whence 49° — 13° = 36°,
as before.

From these experiments it seems demon-
strated, that the greatest density of water is
at or near the 36° of the old scale, and $7° or
38° of the new scale: and further, that the
expansion of thin glass is nearly the same as
that of iron, whilst that of stone ware is 3,
and brown earthen ware 3 of the same.

The apparent expansion of mercury in a
thermometrical glass for 180° I find to be .0163
from 1. That of thin glass may be stated at
.0037 = +s, which is rather less than iron,
xiy- Consequently the real expansion of mer-
cury from $2° to 212° is equal to the sum of
these = .02 or =. De Luc makes it, .01836,
and most other authors make it less; because
they -have all under-rated the expansion of
glass. Hence we derive this proportion,
0163 : 180° :; .0037 ; 41° nearly, which ex-
presses the effect of the expansion of glass on

--- Page 47 ---
ON EXPANSION. 35

the mercurial thermometer: that is, the mer-
cury would rise 41° higher on the scale
at the temperature of boiling water, if the
glass had no expansion.—De Luc makes the
expansion of a glass tube from 32° to 212° =
.00083 in length, and from 32° to 122° only
00035. This inequality arises in part at least,
T apprehend, from the want of equilibrium in
the original fixation of glass tubes, the outside
being hard when the inside is soft.

Liquids may be denominated pure when
they are not decomposed by heat and cold.
Solutions of salts in water cannot be deemed
such ; because their constitution is affected by
temperature. Thus, if a solution of sulphate
of soda in water be cooled, a portion of the
salt crystallizes, and leaves the remaining liquid
Jess saline than before; whereas water and
mercury, when partially congealed, leave the
remaining liquid of the same quality as before.
Most acid liquids are similar to saline soiutions
in this respect. Alcohol as we commonly
have it, is a solution of pure alcohol in a
greater or less portion of water : and probably
would be affected by congelation like other
solutions. Ether is one of the purest liquids,
except water and mercury. Oils, both fixed
and volatile, are probably for the most part
impure, in the sense we use it. Notwithstand-

--- Page 48 ---
36 ON EXPANSION,

ing these observations, it is remarkable how
nearly those liquids approximate to the law of
expansion observed in water and mercury.
Few authors have made experiments on these
subjects; and their results in several instances
are incorrect. My own investigations have
been chiefly directed to water and mercury ;
but it may be proper to give the results of my
enquiries on the other liquids as far as they
have been prosecuted.

Alcohol expands about } of its bulk for
180°, from — 8 to 172°. The relative expan-
sions of this liquid are given by De Luc
from 32° to 212°; but the results of my expe-
riments do not seem to accord with his. Ac-
cording to him alcohol expands 35 parts for
the first 90°, and 45 parts for the second 90°.
The strength of his alcohol was such as to fire
gun-powder: but this is an indefinite test.
From my experiments I judge it must have
been very weak. I find 1000 parts of alcohol
of .817 sp. gravity at the temperature 50° be-
came 1079 at the temperature 170° of the
common mercurial scale: at 110° the alcohol
is at 1039, or half a division below the true
mean. Whenthe sp. gravity is .86, I find 1000
parts at 50° become 1072 at 170°; at 110° the
bulk is 1035+, whence the disproportion of
the two parts of the scale is not so much

--- Page 49 ---
ON EXPANSION, 87

in this case as 35 to 37. When the sp.
gravity is 937, I find 1000 parts become
1062 at 170°, and 10293 at 110°; hence the
ratio of the expansion becomes 29} to 321.
When the sp. gravity is ,967, answering to 75
per cent. water, I find 1000 parts at 50° be-
come 1040 at 170°, and 10173 at 110°, giving
aratio of 35 to 45; which is the same as De
Luc gives for alcohol. It is true he takes an
interval of temperature = 180°, and I take one
for 120° only ; but still it is impossible to re-
concile our results. As the expansion of alco-
hol from 172° to 212° must have been con-
jectural, perhaps he has over-rated it. In
reporting these results I have not taken into
account the expansion of the glass vessel, a
large thermometrical bulb, containing about
750 grains of water, and having a tube pro-
portionally wide; consequently the real ex-
pansions must be considered as more rather
than less than above stated. The graduation
of the vessel having been repeatedly examined,
and being the same that was used in deter-
mining the expansion of water, I can place
confidence in the results. Particular care was
taken in these experiments to have the bulb
and stem both immersed in water of the pro-
posed temperature.

As alcohol of .817 sp. gravity contains at

--- Page 50 ---
38 ON EXPANSION.

least 8 per cent. water, it is fair to infer from
the above that a thermometer of pure alcohol
would in no apparent degree differ from one
of mercury in the interval of temperature from
50° to 170°. But when we consider that the
relative expansions of glass, mercury and alco-
hol for this interval, are as 1, 5% and 22 re-
spectively, it must be obvious that the inequa-
lity of the expansion of glass in the higher
and lower parts of the scale, which tends to
equalise the apparent expansion of mercury,
has little influence on alcohol, by reason of its
comparative insignificance. Hence it may be
presumed that a spirit thermometer would be
more equable in its divisions than a mercu-
rial one, in a vessel of uniform expansion.
This it ought to be by theory, because the
point of greatest density or congelation of
alcohol is below that of mercury.

Water being densest at 36°, and alcohol at
avery remote temperature below, it was to
be expected that mixtures of these would be
densest at intermediate temperatures, and those
higher as the water prevailed; thus we find the
disproportion, so observable in the expansion
of water, growing greater and greater in the
mixtures as they approach to pure water.

Water saturated with common salt expands

at 212°; at 129° it is nearly 1023, which
gives the ratio of 23 to 27 for the correspond-
ing equal intervals of mercury. This is
nearly the same as De Luc’s ratio of 36.5 to
43,7, This solution is said to congeal at —7°,
and probably expands nearly as the square of
the temperature from that point. It differs
from most other saline solutions in regard to
its expansion by temperature.

Olive and linseed oils expand about $ per
cent. by 180° of temperature ; De Luc finds
the expansion of olive oil nearly correspond
to mercury ; with me it is more disproportion-
ate, nearly agreeing with water saturated with
salt.

Oil of turpentine expands about 7 per cent.
for 180° ; itexpands much more in the higher
than in the lower part of the scale, as it ought to
do, the freezing point being stated at 14 or
16°. The ratio is somewhere about 3 to 5.
Several authors have it that oil of turpentine
boils at 560°; Ido not know how the mis-
take originated ; but it boils below 212°, like
the rest of the essential oils.

Sulphuric acid, sp. gravity 1.85 expands
about 6 per cent. from 32° to 212°. It accords
with mercury as nearly as possible in every
part of the scale. Dr. Thomson says the
freezing point of acid of this strength is at

--- Page 52 ---
40 ON EXPANSION.

—36° or below ; whence it accords with the
same law as water and mercury. I find that
even the glacial sulphuric acid, or that of
1.78 sp. gravity, which remains congealed at
45°, expands uniformly, or nearly like the
other, whilst it continues liquid.

Nitric acid, sp. gravity 1.40, expands about
11 per cent. from 32° to 212°; the expansion
is nearly of the same rate as that of mercury,
the disproportion not being more than 27 to
28 or thereabouts. The freezing point of acid
of this strength is near the freezing point of
mercury.

Muriatic acid, sp. gravity 1.137, expands
about 6 per cent. from 32° to 212°; it is
more disproportionate than nitric acid, as
might be expected, being so largely diluted
with water. The ratio is nearly 6 to 7.

Sulphuric ether expands after the rate of
7 per cent. for 180° of temperature. I have
only compared the expansion of this liquid
with that of mercury from 60° to 90°. In
this interval it accords so nearly with mercury
that I could perceive no sensible difference in
their rates. It is said to freeze at —46°.

From what has been observed it may be
seen that water expands less than most other
liquids; yet it ought to be considered as hav-
ing in reality the greatest rate of expansion.

ON EXPANSION. 41

Alcohol and nitric acid, which appear to ex-
pand so much, do not excel, or even equal
water, if we estimate their expansion from.
the temperature of greatest density, and com-
pare them with water in like circumstances.
It is because we begin with them at 100 or 200°
above the point of greatest density, and ob-
serve their expansion for 180° further, that
they appear to expand so largely. Water, if it
continued liquid, would expand three times
as much in the second interval of 180° as it
does in the first, reckoning from 36°,

EXPANSION OF SOLIDS.

No general aw has hitherto been discovered
respecting the expansion of solid bodies; but
as elastic fluids and liquids appear to be sub-
ject to their respective laws in this particular,
we may confidently expect that solids will be
found so too. As it may be presumed tnat
solids undergo no change of form, by the ab-
straction of heat, it is probable that whatever
the law may be, it will respect the point at
which temperature commences, or what may
be called, absolute cold. It is not our pre-
sent business to enquire how low this point is ;
but it may be observed that every phenomenon

--- Page 54 ---
42 ON EXPANSION.

indicates it to be very low, or much lower
than is commonly apprehended. Perhaps it
may hereafter be demonstrated that the inter-
val of temperature from $2° to 212° of Fahren-
heit, constitutes the 10th, 15th, or 20th inter-
val from absolute cold. Judging from analogy,
we may conjecture that the expansion of solids
is progressively increasing with the tempera-
ture ; but whether it is a geometrical progres-
sion as elastic fluids, or one increasing as the
square of the temperature, like liquids, or as
the 3d or any power of the temperature, still
if it be estimated from absolute cold, it must
appear to be nearly uniform, or in arithmetical
progression to the temperature, for so small
and remote an interval of temperature as
that between freezing and boiling water. The
truth of this observation will appear from the
following calculation : let us suppose the inter-
val in question to be the 15th; then the real
temperature of freezing water will be 2520,
the mid-way to boiling 2610°, and boiling
water 2700°, reckoned from absolute cold.

Now the differences above represent the
ratios of expansion for 90° of temperature;
they are in the former case as 57 to 59, andin
the latter as 14 to 15 nearly. But the tem-
perature being supposed to be measured by
the new scale, the mean is about 110° of the
old scale; therefore the expansion of solids
should be as 57 or 14 from $2° to 110°, and as
59 or 15 from 110° to 212° of the old scale.
If these conjectures be right, the expansion of
solids ought to be something greater in the low-
er part of the old scale, and something less in
the higher part. Experience at present does
not enable us to decide the question. For all
practical purposes we may adopt the notion of
the equable expansion of solids. Only glass
has been found to expand increasingly with the
temperature, and this arises probably from its
peculiar constitution, as has been already ob-
served,

Various pyrometers, or instruments for mea-
suring the expansion of solids, have been in-
vented, of which accounts may be seen in
books of natural philosophy. Their object is
to ascertain the expansion in length of any
proposed subject. The longitudinal expansion
being found, that of the bulk may be derived
from it, and will be three times as much.
Thus, if a bar of 1000 expand to 1001 by a

of the same will become 1003 by the same
temperature.

of the principal subjects hitherto determined,

Wedgwood’s Thermometer.

The spirit thermometer serves to measure
the greatest degrees of cold we are acquainted
with, and the mercurial thermometer measures
400° above boiling water, by the old scale, or
about 250° by the new one, at which tempera-
ture the mercury boils. This is short of red
heat, and very far short of the highest attain-
able temperature. An instrument to measure
high temperatures is very desirable; and Mr.
Wedgwood’s is the best we have yet; but
there is still great room for improvement.
Small cylindrical pieces of clay, composed in
the manner of earthen ware, and slightly
baked, are the thermometrical pieces. When
used, one of them is exposed in a crucible to
the heat proposed to be measured, and after
cooling, it is found to be contracted, in pro-
portion to the heat previously sustained ; the
quantity of contraction being measured, indi-
cates the temperature. The whole range of
this thermometer is divided into 240 equal
degrees, cach of which is calculated to be
equal to 130° of Fahrenheit. The lowest, or 0,
is found about 1077°of Fahrenheit (supposing the
common scale continued above boiling mer-
cury,) and the highest $32277°. According to
the new views of temperature in the preceding

pages, there is reason to think these numbers
are much too large.

SECTION 3,

ON THE

SPECIFIC HEAT OF BODIES.

If the whole quantity of heat in a measute
of water of a certain temperature be denoted
by 1, that in the same measure of mercury will
be denoted by .5 nearly: hence the specific
heats of water and mercury, of equal bulks,
may be signified by 1 and .5 respectively.

If the specific heats be taken from equal
weights of the two liquids; then they will be

--- Page 60 ---
46 ON SPECIFIC HEAT.

denoted by 1 and .04 nearly; because we
have to divide .5 by 13.6, the specific gravity
of mercury.

That bodies differ much in their specific
heats, is manifest from the following facts.

1. Ifa measure of mercury of 212° be
mixed with a measure of water of 32°, the
mixture will be far below the mean tempera-
ture.

2. If a measure of mercury of 32° be mix-
ed with a measure of water of 212°, the
inixture will be far above the mean.

3. If two equal and like vessels be filled,
the one with hot water, the other with hot
mercury; the latter will cool in about half
the time of the former.

4, Ifa measure of sulphuric acid be mixed
with a measure of water of the same tempe-
rature, the mixture will assume a temperature
about 240° higher.

These facts clearly shew that bodies have
various affinities for heat, and that those bodies
which have the strongest attraction or affinity
for heat, possess the most of it in like circum-
stances ; in other words, they are said to have
the greatest capacity for heat, or the greatest
specific heat. It is found too that the same
body changes its capacity for heat, or appa-
rently assumes a new affinity, with a change of

--- Page 61 ---
ON SPECIFIC HEAT. 49

form. This no doubt arises from a new
arrangement or disposition of its ultimate par-
ticles, by which their atmospheres of heat are
influenced : Thus a solid body, as ice, on be-
coming liquid, acquires a larger capacity for
heat, even though its bulk is diminished ; and
a liquid, as water, acquires a larger capacity
for heat om being converted into an elastic
fluid ; this last increase is occasioned, we may
conceive, solely by its being increased in
bulk, in consequence of which every atom of
liquid possesses a larger sphere than before.

A very important enquiry is, whether the
same body in the same state undergoes any
change of capacity by change of temperature.
Does water, for instance, at 32° possess the
same capacity for heat, as at 212°, and through
all the intermediate degrees? Dr. Crawford,
and most writers after him, contend, that the
capacities of bodies in such circumstances are
nearly permanent. As an outline of doctrine
this may be admitted; but it is requisite, if
possible, to ascertain, whether the small change
of capacity induced by temperature, is such as
to increase the capacity, or to diminish it ; and
also, whether the increase or diminution is
uniform or otherwise. Till this point is settled,
it is of little use to mix water of 32° and 212%

--- Page 62 ---
50 ON SPECIFIC HEAT.

with a view to obtain the true mean tempera-
ture.

That water increases in its capacity for heat
with the increase of temperature, I consider
demonstrable from the following arguments:
1st. A measure of water of any one tempera-
ture being mixed with a measure at any other
temperature, the mixture is less than two
measures. Now a condensation of volume
is a certain mark of diminution of capacity
and increase of temperature, whether the con-
densation be the effect of chemical agency, as
in the mixture of sulphuric acid and water,
or the effect of mechanical pressure, as with
elastic fluids. 2. When the same body sud-
denly changes its capacity by a change of form,
it is always from a less to a greater, as the
temperature ascends ; for instance, ice, water
and vapour. 3. Dr. Crawford acknowledges
from his own experience, that dilute sulphuric
acid, and most other liquids he tried, were
found to increase in their capacity for heat with
the increase of temperature.

Admitting the force of these arguments, it
follows that when water of $2° and 212° are
mixed, and give a temperature denoted by
119° of the common thermometer, we must
conclude that the true mean temperature is
somewhere below that degree. I have already

--- Page 63 ---
ON SPECIFIC HEAT. 51

assigned the reasons why I place the mean at
110°,

With respect to the question whether water
varies uniformly or otherwise in its capacity,
I am inclined to think the increase, in this re-
spect, will be found nearly proportional to the
increase in bulk, and consequently will be four
times as much at 212° as at the mean. Per-
haps the expressions for the bulk may serve
for the capacity ; if so, the ratios of the capa-
cities at 32°, 122° and 219° of the new scale,
may be denoted by 22, 22: and 23. I should
rather expect, however, that the ratios are
much nearer equality, and that 200, 201 and
204, would be nearer the truth.*

* Inthe Lectures I delivered in Edinburgh and Glas+
gow in the spring of 1807, I gave it as my opinion that
the capacity of water at 32° was to that at 212°, as 5 to 6,
nearly. The opinion was founded on the fact I had just
before observed, that a small mercurial thermometer at the
temperature 32° being plunged into boilitg water, rose to
202° in 15”; but the same at 212° being plunged into
ice-cold water, was 18” in descending to 42°; estimating
the capacities to be reciprocally as the times of cooling, it
gave the ratio of 5 to 6." On more mature consideration I
am persuaded this difference is occasioued, not so much by
the difference of capacities, as by the different degrees of
fluidity. Water of 212° is more fluid than water of 32°,
and distributes the temperature with greater facility. By
a subsequent experiment too, I find, that mercury cools a

--- Page 64 ---
52 ON SPECIFIC HEAT.

Dr. Crawford, when investigating the ac-
curacy of the common thermometer, was aware,
that if equal portions of water of different
temperatures were mixed together, and the
thermometer always indicated the mean, this
was not an infallible proof of its accuracy.
Ue allows that if water have an increasing
capacity, and the mercury expand increasingly
with the temperature, an equation may be
formed so as to deceive us. This is in fact
the case in some degree ; and he appears to
have been deceived by it. Yet the increased
capacity of water, is by no means sufficient to
balance the increased expansion of the mercu-
ry, as appears from the following experiments,

T took a vessel of tinned iron, the capacity
of which was found to be equal to 2 oz. of
water; into this were put 58 ounces of water,
making the sum = 60 ounces of water. The
whole was raised to any proposed tempera-
ture, and then two ounces of ice were put
in and melted; the temperature was then ob-
served, as follows:

thermometer twice as fast as water, though it has but half
its capacity for heat; the times in which a thermometer is
in cooling in fluids, are not, therefore, tests of their specific
heats.

ON SPECIFIC HEAT, 53

60 oz.water of 212° + 2 oz.ice of 32°, gave 200°E
60 oz.water of 190°+ 2 oz.ice of 32°, gave 122°
60 oz.water of 50°+ 2 oz.ice of 32°, gave 45°.3

From the first of these, 30 parts of water
lost 11° each, or 345°, and 1 part water of
$2° gained 168°; the difference 345 — 1683
= 176°s, expresses the number of degrees of
temperature (such as are found between 200
and 212 of the old scale) entering into ice of
32° to convert it into water of 32°, Similar
calculations being made for the other two,
we find in the second, 150°, and in the third,
128°. These three resulting numbers are
nearly as 5, 6 and 7. Hence it follows that
as much heat is.necessary to raise water 5° in
the lower part of the old scale, as is required
to raise it 7° in the higher, and 6° in the mid-
dle.*

Methods of finding the Specific Heats of
Bodies.

The most obvious method of ascertaining the
specific heats of bodies that have no chemical

* Perhaps the above results may account for the diver-
sity in authors respecting the quantity of latent heat (im-
properly so called) in water. Respecting the doctrine of
Black on Latent Heat, see an excellent note of Leslie.

54 ON SPECIFIC HEAT.

affinity for water, is to mix equal weights of
water, and any proposed body of two known
temperatures, and to mark the temperature of
the mixture. Thus, if a pound of water of
32°, and a pound of mercury of 212°, be
mixed, and brought to a common tempera-
ture, the water will be raised m degrees, and
the mercury depressed x degrees; and their
capacities or specific heats will be inversely
as those numbers; or, n‘ m ‘: specific heat of
water : specific heat of mercury. In this
way Black, Irvine, Crawford and Wilcke,
approximated to the capacities of various bo-
dies. Such bodies as have an affinity for water,
may be confined in a vessel of known capa-
city, and plunged into water so as to be heated
or cooled, as in the former case.

The results already obtained by this method
are liable to two objections : Ist. the authors
presume the capacities of bodies while they
retain their form are permanent; that is, the
specific heat increases exactly in proportion to
the temperature ; and 2d, that the common mer-
curial thermometer is a true test of temperature.
But it has been shewn that neither of these
positions is warrantable.

The calorimeter of Lavoisier and Laplace
was an ingenious contrivance for the purpose of
investigating specific heat ; it was calculated to

--- Page 67 ---
ON SPECIFIC HEAT, 55

shew the quantity of ice which any body heat-
ed to a given temperature could melt. It was
therefore nat liable to the 2d objection above.
Unfortunately this instrument does not seem to
have answered well in practice.

Meyer attempted to find the capacities of
dried woods, by observing the times in which
given equal volumes of them were in cooling.
These times he considered as proportionate
to the capacities bulk for bulk; and when
the times were divided by the specific gravities,
the quotient represented the capacities of equal
weights. (Annal. de Chemie Tom. 30). Leslie
has since recommended a similar mode for
liquids, and given us the results of his trials
on 5 of them. From my own experience I
am inclined to adopt this method as suscep-
tible of great precision. The times in which
bodies cool in like circumstances appear to
be ascertainable this way with uncommon
exactness, and as they are mostly very different,
a very small error is of little consequence. The
results too I find to agree with those by mix-
ture; and they have the advantage of not
being affected by any error in the thermome-
tric scale,

The formule for exhibiting the phenomena
of the specific heats of bodies are best con-
ceived from the contemplation of cylindrical

vessels of unequal bases. (See plate 1. Fig. 1).
Supposing heat to be represented by a quantity
of liquid in each vessel, and temperature by
the height of the liquid in the vessel, the
base denoting the zero or total privation of
heat ; then the specific heats of bodies at any
given temperature, 2, will be denoted by
multipling the area of the several bases by
the height or temperature, x. Those specific
heats too will be directly as the bases, or as
the increments of heat necessary to produce
equal changes of temperature.

Let wand W= the weights of two cold
and hot bodies; ¢ and C their capacities
for heat at the same temperature (or the bases
of the cylinders); d= the difference of the
temperature of the two bodies before mixture,
reckoned in degrees ; m = the elevation of the
colder body, and x = the depression of the
warmer after mixture, (supposing them to have
no chemical action); then we obtain the fol-
lowing equations.

have made great number of experiments with
a view to eniarge, but more especially, to
correct the Tables of Specific Heat. It may
be proper to relate some of the particulars.
For liquids I used an egg-shaped thin glass
vessel, capable of holding eight ounces of
water; to this was adapted a cork, with a
small circular hole, sufficient to admit the stem
of a delicate thermometer tube, which had
two small marks with a file, the one at 92°,
and the other at 82°, both being above the
cork; when the cork was in the neck of
the bottle, the bulb of the thermometer was
in the centre of the internal capacity. When
an experiment was made the bottle was filled
with the proposed liquid, and heated a little

above 92°; it was then suspended in the
middle of a room, and the time accurately
noted when the thermometer was at 92°, and
again when it was 82°, another thermometer
at the same time indicating the temperature
of the air in the room. The capacity of the
glass vessel was found = 3 oz. of water.

not enter into consideration. But as the heat
of that was proved to be equal to + of an
ounce of water, or to + of an ounce measure
of oil, ‘it is evident we must consider the
heat disengaged in the Ist experiment, as from
8 2 ounces of water, and in the last as from
9 4 ounce measures of oil. On this account
the numbers below 29 will require a small
reduction, before they can be allowed to re-
present the times of cooling of equal bulks of
the different liquids; in the last experiment
the reduction will be one minute, and less in
all the preceding ones,

It may be proper to observe, that the above
results do not depend upon one trial of the
several articles ; most of the experiments were
repeated several times, and the times of cool-
ing were found not to differ more than half a
minute; indeed, in general, there was no
sensible differences. If the air in the room was,
in any case, a little above or below 52°, the due
allowance was made.

I found the specific heat of mercury, by
mixture with water, and by the time of its cool-
ing ina smaller vessel than the above, to be
to that of water of equal bulk, as, .55 to }
nearly.

Crawford ; having procured a goblet, of very
thin glass and small stem, I found its capacity
for heat; then put water into it, such that
the water, together with the value of the glass
in water, might be equal to the weight of
the solid. The solid was raised to 212°, and
suddenly plunged into the water, and the spe-
cific heats of equal weights of the solid and
the water, were inferred to be inverscly as
the charges of temperature which they expe-
rienced, according to the 6th formula. Some
regard was paid to the correction, on account
of the error of the common thermometer,
which was used on the occasion. The solids
I tried were iron, copper, lead, tin, zinc,
antimony, nickel, glass, pitcoal, &c. The
results differed little from those of Wilcke and
Crawford ; their numbers may, therefore, be
adopted without any material error, till greater
precision can be attained. In the following
Table I have not carried the decimals beyond
two places; because present experience will
not warrant further extension: the first place
of decimals may, I believe, be relied upon as
accurate, and the second generally so, but ip
a few instances it may, perhaps, be 1 or 2
wrong; except from this observation, the
specific heats of the gases by Crawford, on
which I shall further remark.

Remarks on the Table.

The articles marked * are from Crawford.
Notwithstanding the ingenuity and address
displayed in his experiments on the capacities
of the elastic fluids, there is reason to believe
his results are not very near approximations to
the truth; we can never expect accuracy when
it depends upon the observation of 1 or 2
tenths of a degree of temperature after a tedi-
ous and complicated process. Great merit is
undoubtedly due to him for the attempt.—
The difference between arterial and venous
blood, on which he has founded the beauti-
ful system of animal heat, is remarkable,
and deserves further enquiry.

From the observed capacities of water, so-
lution of ammonia, and the combustibles, into
which hydrogen enters, together with its small
specific gravity, we cannot doubt but that this
element possesses a very superior specific heat.
Oxygen, and azote likewise, undoubtedly stand
high, as water and ammonia indicate ; but the
compound of these two elements denominated
nitric acid, being so low, compared with the
same joined to hydrogen, or water and ammo-
nia, we must conclude that the superiority of
the two last articles is chiefly due to the hydro-
gen they contain. ‘The elements, charcoal and

--- Page 76 ---
6+ ON SPECIFIC HEAT,

sulphur, are remarkably low, and carry their
character along with them into compounds, as
oil, sulphuric acid, &c.

Water appears to possess the greatest capa-
city for heat of any pure liquid yet known,
whether it be compared with equal bulks or
weights ; indeed it may be doubted, whether
any solid or liquid whatever contains more
heat than an equal bulk of water of the same
temperature. The great capacity of water
arises from the strong affinity, which both its
elements, hydrogen, and oxygen, have for
heat. Hence it is that solutions of salts in
water, contain generally less heat in a given
volume than pure water: for, salts increase
the volume of water as well as the density,
and having mostly a small capacity for heat,
they enlarge the volume of the water more
than proportional to the heat they contribute.

Pure ammonia seems to possess a high specific
heat, judging from the aqueous solution, which
contains only about 10 per cent.—If it could
be exhibited pure in a liquid form, it would
probably exceed water in this particular.

The compounds of hydrogen and carbon,
under the characters of oil, ether and alcohol,
and the woods, all fall below the two last
mentioned ; the reason seems to be, because
charcoal is an element of a low specific heat.

--- Page 77 ---
ON SPECIFIC HEAT. 65

The acids form an interesting class of bedies
in regard to their specific heats.—Lavoisier is
the only one who is nearly correct in regard to
nitric acid; he finds the specific heat of the
acid 1.3 ta be .66; this with some other of his
results I find rather too low. It is remarkable
that the water in acid of this strength is
63 per cent. and should have nearly as
much heat in it as the compound is found to
have, whence it should seem that the acid
loses the principal part of its heat on combining
with water. This is still more observable in
muriatic acid, which contains 80 per cent. of
water, and its specific heat is only .60 ; whence
not only the heat of the acid gas, but part of
that in the water is expelled on the union ; this
accounts for the great heat produced by the
union of this acid gas with water.

The specific heat of sulphuric acid has beea
well approximated by several.—Gadolin and
Leslie make it .34, Lavoisier .$3+ ; Crawford
finds it .43, but he must probably have had a
diluted acid.

Common vinegar, being water with 4 or 5
per cent. of acid, does not differ materially
from water in its specific heat; it has been
stated at .39 and at .10; but such results do
not require animadversion. The acetic acid

--- Page 78 ---
66 ON SPECIFIC HEAT.

I used contained 33 per cent. pure acid;
this acid therefore, in combining with water,
expels much heat.

Quicklime is determined by Lavoisier and
Crawford to be .22; I think they have under-
rated it: I find quicklime to impart as much
or more heat than carbonate of lime, when
inclosed in a vessel and plunged in water, or
when mixed with oi]. Hydrat of lime (that
is, quicklime 3 parts and water 1 part, or dry
slaked lime) is fixed at .28 by Gadolin: it
was .25 by my first experiments ; but I since
find I have underrated it. The subject will be
adverted to in a future section.

SECTION 4.

THEORY OF THE SPECIFIC HEAT OF
ELASTIC FLUIDS,

Since the preceding section was printed off,
I have spent some time in considering the
constitution of elastic fluids with regard to
heat. The results already obtained cannot: be
relied upon ; yet it is difficult to conceive and
execute experiments less exceptionable than
those of Crawford. It is extremely important,

--- Page 79 ---
THEORY OF SPECIFIC HEAT. 67

however, to obtain the exact specific heat of
elastic fluids, because the phenomena of com-
bustion and of heat in general, and conse-
quently a great part of chemical agency, are
intimately connected therewith.

In speaking of the uncertainty of Crawford’s
results on the specific heat of elastic fluids,
it must not be understood that all of them
are equally implicated. The reiterated ex-
periments on the heat giveh out by the com-
bustion of hydrogen, in which it was found
that 11 measures of mixed gases, when fired
by electricity heated 20.5 measures of water
2°.4 (page 263) at a medium, were suscepti-
ble of very considerable accuracy, and are
therefore entitled to credit. The comparative
heat of atmospheric air and water, which rested
on the observance of nearly 5 of a degree of
temperature, is probably not very far from the
truth; but the very small differences in the
heats communicated by equal bulks of oxygen,
hydrogen, carbonic acid, azotic gas and com-
mon air, together with the great importance
of those differences in the calculation, render
the results very uncertain. He justly observes,
that if we suppose the heats imparted by
equal bulks of these gases to be equal, it will
nat affect his doctrine. The tenor of it neces-
sarily led him to estimate the heat of oxygen

--- Page 80 ---
68 THEORY OF SPECIFIC HEAT.

high, compared with equal weights of carbo:
nic acid and aqueous vapour, and of azotic
gas or phlogisticated air, as it was then called,
under the idea of its being an opposite to oxy-
gen or dephlogisticated air. Indeed his de-
ductions respecting azotie gas, are not con-
sistent with his experiments: for he makes no
use of experiments 12 and 13, which are the
only direct ones for the purpose, but he infers
the heat of azotic gas from the observed differ-
ence between oxygen and common air. The
result gives it less than half that of common
air ; whereas from the 13th experiment, scarcely
any sensible difference was perceived between
them. He has in all probability much wnder-
sated it; but his errors in this respect what-
ever they may be, do not affect his system.

When we consider that all elastic fluids are
equally expanded by temperature, and that
liquids and solids are not so, it should seem
that a general law for the affection of elastic
fluids for heat, ought to be more easily deduci-
ble and more simple than one for liquids, or
solids.—There are three suppositions in regard
to elastic fluids which merit discussion.

1, Equal weights of elastic fluids may have
the same quantity of heat under like circum-
stances of temperature and pressure.

The truth of this supposition is disproved

--- Page 81 ---
THEORY OF SPECIFIC HEAT. 69

by several facts: oxygen and hydrogen upon
their union give out much heat, though they
form steam, on elastic fluid of the same
weight as the elements composing it. Nitrous
gas and oxygen unite under similar circum.
stances. Carbonic acid is formed by the unica
of charcoal, a substance of low specific heat,
with oxygen ; much heat is given out, which
must be principally derived from the oxygen;
if then the charcoal contain little heat, and the
oxygen combining with it be reduced, the
carbonic acid must be far inferior in heat ro an
equal weight of oxygenous gas.

2. Equal bulks of elastic fluids may have
the same quantity of heat with the same pres-
sure and temperature.

This appears much more plausible; the
diminution of volume when a mixture of oxy-
gen and hydrogen is converted into steam, may
be occasioned by a proportionate diminution
of the absolute heat ; the same may be said of
a mixture of nitrous gas and oxygen. The
minute differences observed by Crawford, may
have been inaccuracies occasioned by the com-
plexity of his experiments.—But there are
other considerations which render this suppo-
sition extremely improbable, if they do not
altogether disprove it. Carbonic acid contains
its own bulk of oxygen; the heat given out at

--- Page 82 ---
710 THEORY OF SPECIFIC HEAT.

its formation must therefore be exactly equal
to the whole heat previously contained in the
charcoal on this supposition ; but the heat by
the combustion of one pound of charcoal
seems, at least, equal to the heat by the com-
bustion of a quantity of hydrogen sufficient to
produce one pound of water, and this last is
equal to, or more than the heat retained by
the water, because steam is nearly twice the
density of the elastic mixture from which it is
produced; it should therefore follow, that
charcoal should be found of the same specific
heat as water, whereas it is only about 3 of it.
Were this supposition true, the specific heats of
elastic fluids of equal weights would be in-
versely as their specific gravities—If that of
steam or aqueous vapour were represented by
1, oxygen would be .64, hydrogen 8.4, azote
.72, and carbonic acid .46.—But the supposi-
tion is untenable.

3. The quantity of heat belonging to the
ultimate particles of all elastic fluids, must be
the same under the same pressure and tem-
perature.

It is evident the number of ultimate par-
ticles or molecules ina given weight or volume
of one gas is not the same asin another: for,
if equal measures of azotic and oxygenous
gases were mixed, and could be instantly

--- Page 83 ---
THEORY OF SPECIFIC HEAT. vel

united chemically, they would form nearly two
measures of nitrous gas, having the same
weight as the two original measures; but the
number of ultimate particles could at most be
one half of that before the union. No two
elastic fluids, probably, therefore, have the
same number of particles, either in the same
volume or the same weight. Suppose, then,
a given volume of any elastic fluid to be con-
stituted of particles, each surrounded with an
atmosphere of heat repelling each other through
the medium of those atmospheres, and in a
state of equilibrium under the pressure of a
constant force, such as the earth’s atmosphere,
also at the temperature of the surrounding
bodies ; suppose further, that by some sudden
change each malecule of air was endued with
a stronger affinity for heat ; query the change
that would take place in consequence of this
last supposition? The only answer that can
be given, as it appears to me, is this.—The
particles will condense their respective atmos-
pheres of heat, by which their mutual repul-
sion will be diminished, and the external pres-
sure will therefore effect a proportionate con-
densation in the volume of air: neither an
increase nor diminution in the quantity of heat
around each malecule, or around the whole,
will take place, Hence the truth of the sup-

--- Page 84 ---
12 THEORY OF SPECIFIC HEAT,

position, or as it may now be called, proposi-
tion, is demonstrated.

Corol. 1. The specific heats of equal weights
of any two elastic fluids, are inversely as the
weights of their atoms or molecules.

2. The specific heats of equal buds of elastic
fluids, are directly as their specific gravities,
and inversely as the weights of their atoms.

3. Those elastic fluids that have their atoms
the most condensed, have the strongest attrac-
tion for heat; the greater attraction is spent
in accumulating more heat in a given space or
volume, but does not increase the quantity
around any single atom,

4, When two elastic atoms unite by chemi-
cal affinity to form one elastic atom, one half
of their heat is disengaged. When three
unite, then two thirds of their heat is disen-
gaged, &c. And in general, when m elastic
particles by chemical union become 1; the
heat given out is to the heat retained as m—n
is to n.

One objection to this proposition it may be
proper to obviate: it will be said, an increase
in the specific attraction of each atom must
produce the same effect on the system as an
increase of external ‘pressure. Now this last
is known to express or give out a quantity of
the absolute heat; therefore the former must

--- Page 85 ---
THEORY OF SPECIFIC HEAT. 713

do the same. This conclusion must be admit-
ted ; and it tends to establish the truth of the
preceding proposition. The heat expressed by
doubling the density of any elastic fluid amounts
to about 50°, according to my former experi-
ments; this heat is not so much as one hun-
dreth part of the whole, as will be shewn
hereafter, and therefore does not materially
affect the specific heat: it seems to be merely
the interstitial heat amongst the small globular
molecules of air, and scarcely can be said to
belong to them, because it is equally found in
a vacuum or space devoid of air, as is proved
by the increase of temperature upon admitting
air into a vacuum.

Before we can apply this doctrine to find the
specific heat of clastic fluids, we must first
ascertain the relative weights of their ultimate
particles. Assuming at present what will be
proved hereafter, that if the weight of an
atom of hydrogen be 1, that of oxygen will be
7, azote 5, nitrous gas 12, nitrous oxide 17,
carbonic acid 19, ammoniacal gas 6, carbu-
retted hydrogen 7, olefiant gas 6, nitric acid
19, carbonic oxide 12, sulphuretted hydrogen
16, muriatic acid 22, aqueous vapour 8, ethe-
real vapour 11, and alcoholic vapour 16; we
shall have the specific heats of the several
elastic fluids as in the following table. In

--- Page 86 ---
14 THEORY OF SPECIFIC HEAT.

order to compare them with that of water,
we shall further assume the specific heat of
water to that of steam as 6 to 7, oras 1 to
1,166.

Let us now see how far these results will
accord with experience. It is remarkable that
the heat of common air comes out nearly the
same as Crawford found it by experiment ;
also, hydrogen excels all the rest as he deter-
mined ; but oxygen is much lower and azote
higher. The principles of Crawford’s doctrine
of animal heat and combustion, however, are
not at all affected with the change. Besides
the reason already assigned for thinking that
azote has been rated too low, we see from the
Table, page 62, that ammonia, a compound

--- Page 87 ---
ON HEAT BY COMBUSTION. 75

of hydrogen and azote, has a higher specific
heat than water, a similar compound of hydro-
gen and oxygen.

Upon the whole, there is not any established
fact in regard to the specific heats of bodies,
whether elastic or liquid, that is repugnant to
the above table as far as I know; and it is to
be hoped, that some principle aualogous to
the one here adopted, may soon be extended
to solid and liquid bodies in general.

SECTION 5.

on THE
QUANTITY OF HEAT EVOLVED
BY COMBUSTION.

When certain bodies unite chemically with
oxygen, the process is denominated combustion,
and is generally accompanied with the evolu-
tion of heat, in consequence of the diminished
capacities of the products. The fine attempt
of Lavoisier and Laplace to find the quantities
of heat disengaged during different species of
combustion, has not been followed up with
the attention ic deserves. Perhaps this may
have been owing to the supposed necessity of

--- Page 88 ---
76 ON HEAT BY COMBUSTION.

using the calorimeter of the above philosophers,
and to a notion that its results are not always
to be depended upon. Much important in-
formation may, however, be obtained on this
subject by the use of a very simple apparatus,
as will appear from what follows:

I took a bladder, the bulk of which, when
extended with air, was equal to 30000 grains
of water; this was filled with any combustible
gas, and a pipe and stop-cock adapted to it :
a tinned vessel, capable of containing 30000
grains of water was provided, and its capacity
for heat being found, so much water was put
into it as to make the vessel and water together,
equal to 30000 grains of water. The gas was
lighted, and the point of the small flame was
applied to the concavity of the bottom of the
tinned vessel, till the whole of the gas was
consumed ; the increase of the temperature of
the water was then carefully noted; whence the
effect of the combustion of a given volume
of gas, of the common pressure and tempera-
ture, in raising the temperature of an equal
volume of water, was ascertained, except a
very small loss of heat by radiation, &c. which
this method must be liable to, and which pro-
bably does not exceed } or 7,th of the whole.

The mean results of several trials of the
different gases are stated below; when the

--- Page 89 ---
ON HEAT BY COMBUSTION. 77

experiments are performed with due care,
there is scarcely any sensible differences in
the results with the same species of gas. The
point of the flame should just touch the bottom
of the vessel.

The five last articles were placed upon a

--- Page 90 ---
18 ON HEAT BY COMBUSTION,

was ignited, then weighed, and the combus-
tion was maintained bya gentle blast from a
blow-pipe, directing the heat as much as pos-
sible upon the bottom of the vessel ; after the
operation it was again weighed, and the loss
ascertained; the result never amounted to 2°
for ten grains, but generally approached it
nearly.

In order to exhibit the comparative effects
more clearly, it may be proper to reduce the
articles to a common weight, and to place
along with them the quantity of oxygen known
to combine with them. The quantity of heat
given out may well be expressed by the num.
ber of pounds of ice which it would melt,
taking it for granted that the quantity neces-
sary to melt ice, is equal to that which would
raise water 150° of the new scale. The re-
sults may be seen in the following table.

Lavoisier has left us a similar table derived
from experiments on the calorimeter, for hydro-
gen, phosphorus, charcoal, oil and wax; and
Crawford for hydrogen, charcoal, oil and
wax, derived from their combustion in ano-
ther apparatus. By reducing Crawford's re-
sults to a comparative scale with Lavoisier’s,
they will both appear as follows:

Lavosier, Crawford.

Hyprocen. The near coincidence of La-
vosier’s result and mine is an argument in
favour of their accuracy. Crawford, [ think,
must have overrated the heat produced; his
method of determining it, by the explosion of
the gases by electricity, seems however sus-
ceptible of precision, and ought to be repeat-
ed. The truth perhaps lies between the two.

Puosrorus. Lavoisier’s result, which is
much greater than mine, must, I think, be too
high. I suspect that 66 is as much as can be
fairly inferred.

Cuarcoat. The inferiority of my results to
those of Crawford is what might be expected.

--- Page 92 ---
80 ON HEAT BY COMBUSTION,

Mine must necessarily be rather too low.
But Lavoisier is in this as well as all the
other articles, hydrogen excepted, unwar-
rantably too high. I think Crawford will
be found too high ; his experiments on the heat
produced by the respiration of animals, sup-
port this supposition.

Wax anv Om. Crawford’s results are a
little lower than mine, which they ought not to
be, and are doubtless below the truth. Lavoi-
sier’s certainly cannot be supported. This great
philosopher was well aware of the uncertainty
of his results, and expresses himself accord-
ingly. He seems not to have had an adequate
idea of the heat of hydrogen gas, which con-
tributes so much to the quantity given out by
its combustion ; he compares, and expects to
find an equation, between the heat given out
by burning wax, &c. and the heat given out
by the combustion of equal weights of hydro-
gen and charcoal in their separate state; but
this cannot be expected, as both hydrogen and
charcoal in a state of combination must contain
less heat than when separate, agreeably to the
general law of the evolution of heat on com-
bination.—In fact, both Crawford and Lavoi-
sier have been, in some degree, led away by
the notion, that oxygenous gas was the sole
or principal source of the light and heat pro-

--- Page 93 ---
ON HEAT BY COMBUSTION. 81

duced by combustion. This is the more re-
markable of the former, after he had proved
that hydrogerous gas, one of the most frequent
and abundant combustibles, possessed nearly
five times as much heat as the same weight of
oxygenous gas. Azote, another combustible,
possesses as high and probably higher specific
heat than oxygen. Oil, wax, tallow, alcohol,
&c. would be far from being low in the table
of specific heat, provided a table were formed
comprehending bodies of every class. Char-
coal and sulphur rank but low in the table.
Upon the whole then, we cannot adopt the
language of Crawford, “ that inflammable
** bodies contain little absolute heat,’ and
* that the heat which is produced by com-
“ bustion is derived from the air, and not from
the inflammable body.” This language may
be nearly right as applied to the ordinary com-
bustion of charcoal and pitcoal; but cannot
be so when applied universally to combustible
bodies.

After these remarks it is almost unnecessary
to add that the heat, and probably the light
also, evolved by combustion, must be con-
ceived to be derived both from the oxygen
and the combustible body; and that each
contributes, for aught we know to the con-

82 ON HEAT BY COMBUSTION.

trary, in proportion to its specific heat before
the combustion, A similar observation may
be made upon the heat produced by the union
of sulphur with the metals, and every other
chemical union in which heat is evolved.

Before we conclude this section it may be
proper to add, for the sake of those who are
more immediately interested in the economy of
fuel, that the heat given out by the com-
bustion of 1b. of charcoal, and perhaps also
of pitcoal, is sufficient (if there were no loss)
to raise 45 or 50 Ibs. of water from the freeze-
ing to the boiling temperature ; or it is suffici-
ent to convert 7 or 8 Ibs. of water into steam.
If more than this weight of coal be used, there
is a proportionate quantity of heat lost, which
ought, if possible, to be avoided.

SECTION 6.

oN THE
NATURAL ZERO or TEMPERATURE;
Or absolute Privation of Heat.

If we suppose a body at the ordinary tempe-
rature to contain a given quantity of heat, like
as a vessel contains a given quantity of water,

--- Page 95 ---
ON THE ZERO OF TEMPERATURE. 83

it is plain that by abstracting successively small
equal portions, the body would finally be ex-
hausted of the fluid. It is an object of pri-
mary importance in the doctrine of heat to
determine, how many degrees of the ordinary
scale of temperature a body must be depres-
sed before it would lose all its heat, or become
absolutely cold. We have no means of effect-
ing this by direct experiment; but we can
acquire data for a calculus, from which the
zero may be approximated with considerable
accuracy.

The data requisite for the calculus are the
exact specific heats of the several bodies ope-
rated upon, and the quantity of heat evolved,
or absorbed by bodies, in cases of their che-
mical combinations or otherwise. These data
are not to be acquired without great care
and circumspection; and hence the great
diversity of the results hitherto obtained in
this difficult investigation. According to some,
the zero is estimated to be 900° below the
common temperature; whilst, according to
others, it is nearly 8000° below the same.
These are the extremes; but various deter-
minations of an intermediate nature are to be
found.

The most simple case in theory is that of

--- Page 96 ---
84 ON THE ZERO OF TEMPERATURE.

ice and water: supposing the capacities of
these two bodies to be as 9 to 10, at the
temperature of 32°, it is known that ice of
$2° requires as much heat as would raise water
160°, to convert it into water of 32°, or to
melt it. Consequently, according to the 8th
formula, page 57, water of 32°, must contain
10 times as much heat, or 1500°. That is,
the zero must be placed at 1500° below the
temperature of freezing water. Unfortunately,
however, the capacity of ice has not been
determined with sufficient accuracy, partly
because of its being a solid of a bad con-
ducting power, but principally because the
degrees of the common thermometer below
freezing, are very erroneous from the equal
division of the scale.

Besides the one already mentioned, the
principal subjects that have been used in this
investigation are, 1st, mixtures of sulphuric
acid and water; 2d, mixtures of lime and
water; 3d, mixture or combination of nitric
acid and lime; and 4th, combustion of hydro-
gen, phosphorus and charcoal. Upon these
it will be necessary to enlarge.

Mixture of Sulphuric Acid and Water.
According to the experiments of Lavoisier

--- Page 97 ---
ON THE ZERO OF TEMPERATURE. 85

and Laplace on the calorimeter, a mixture of
sulphuric acid and water in the proportion of
4 to 3 by weight, determines the zero at
7292° below freezing water, reckoning by
Fahrenheit. But a mixture of 4 acid with 5
water, determines the same at 2630°.

Gadolin made several experiments on mix-
tures of sulphuric acid and water, the results
of which are as accurate as can be expected
in a first essay of the kind. He has not de-
termined the zero from his experiments, but
taking it for granted to be 1400° below the
freezing point on the supposition that the
capacities of ice and water are as 9 to 10, he
has enquired how far his experiments corro-
borate the same, by comparing the capacities
of the mixtures by experiment with those
calculated from the previous assumption. His
results are thus curtailed in their utility; but as
he has given us data sufficient to calculate the
zero from each experiment, it will be proper
to see how far they accord with Lavoisier’s,
or those of others.

Taking the specific heat of water at 1, Ga-
dolin finds, by direct experiment, the specific
heat of concentrated sulphuric acid to be
~839 (See Crawford on heat, page 465); he
then mixes the acid and water in various

--- Page 98 ---
86 ON THE ZERO OF TEMPERATURE,

proportions, observes the increase of temper-
ature, and then finds the capacities of the
mixtures, Whence we have data to find the
zero by formula 9, page 58. In giving his
numbers, I have changed his scale, the centi-
grade, to Fahrenheit’s.

Acid Water heat evolv. capa. of mix. comp. zero
4 + 1 194° Ad2 2936°
2 +1 203 500 1710
1 +1 161 605 1510
1 + 2 108 «749 2637
1 +5 51 876 3230
1 + 10 28 925 1740

The mean of these is 2300°, which is far
beyond what Gadolin supposes to be the zero,
as deduced from the relative capacities of
ice and water, and to which he seeks to ac-
commodate these experiments.

As the heat evolved upon the mixture of
sulphuric acid and water is so considerable,
and as all three articles are liquids, and con-
sequently admit of having their capacities as-
certained with greater precision, I have long
been occasionally pursuing the investigation
of the zero from experiments on these liquids.
The strongest sulphuric acid of 1.855, I find
has the specific heat .83, and

--- Page 99 ---

16 +1 (1.520) 260 553 4150
1 +2 (1.250) 100 .764 6C00

TI reject all mixtures where the heat is less
than 100°, because the difference between the
observed capacity of the mixture, and the
mean capacity is too small to be determined
with precision. These results differ materially
from Gadolin’s. I believe they will be found
to be nearer approximations to the truth.
When the two liquids are mixed in nearly
equal weights, the results give the zero less
remote than otherwise ; this appears to be the
case both with Gadolin and me; I have not
yet been able to discover the cause of it; per-
haps the capacity of such mixture increases
with the temperature more than in the other
cases.

Lime and Water.

Quicklime, that is, lime recently burned, has
a strong affinity for water; when mixed in
due proportion an intense heat is produced ;
the lime falls, or becomes slaked, and then
may be denominated hydrat of lime. If no more
water is put to quicklime than is sufficient to
slake it, or pulverize it, three parts of lime,

--- Page 100 ---
88 ON THE ZERO OF TEMPERATURE,

by weight, form four parts of hydrat, a per-
fectly dry powder, from which the water
cannot be expelled under ared heat. If more
water is added, the mixture forms mortar, a
pasty compound, from which the excess of
water may be expelled by a boiling heat, and
the hydrat remains a dry powder. When
hydrat of lime and water are mixed, no heat
is evolved ; hence the two form a mere mix-
ture, and not a chemical compound. The
heat then which is evolved in slaking lime,
arises from the chemical union of three parts
of lime and one of water, or from the forma-
tion of the hydrat, and any excess of water
diminishes the sensible heat produced. Before
any use can be made of these facts for deter-
mining the zero, it becomes necessary to de-
termine the specific heat of dry hydrat of
lime. For this purpose a given weight of
lime is to be slaked with an excess of water;
the excess must then be expelled by heat till
the bydrat is } heavier than the lime. A given
weight of this powder may then be mixed
with the same, or any other weight of water
of another temperature, and its specific heat
determined accordingly. By a variety of ex-
periments made in this way, and with sundry
variations, I find the specific heat of hydrat of

--- Page 101 ---
ON THE ZERO OF TEMPERATURE. 89

lime about .40, and not .25 as in the table,
page 62. Lime itself I find to be nearly .30,
Crawford undervalues lime, by mixing cold
lime with hot alcohol; the lime does not pro-
duce a sufficient effect on the alcohol, because
it contains water, which acts upon the lime.
Ihave no doubt a different specific heat would
have been found, if cold alcohol had been
poured on hot lime. The heat evolved in the
formation of hydrat of lime may be found as
follows: If 1 0z. of lime be put into 4 oz. of
water, the temperature of the mixture will be
raised 100°; in this case 14 0z. hydrat is form-
ed, and the heat evolved raises it together with
83 0z. water 100°; but 33 water contains 7
times the heat that 14 hydrat of lime does;
therefore the heat given out is sufficient to
raise 8 times the hydrat 100°, or once the hy-
drat 800°, Whence the heat evolved by mixing
8 parts of lime and 1 of water, is sufficient
to raise the new compound 800°. Applying
then the theorem in page 58, we obtain the
zero = 4260° below the common temperature.

Nitric Acid and Lime.

According to the experiments of Lavoisier
and Laplace, the specific heat of nitric acid,
sp. gt. 1.3, is .661, and that of lime .217, and a
compound of 9} parts of said acid, and one

--- Page 102 ---
90 ON THE ZERO OF TEMPERATURE.

of lime, is .619. But supposing there was
no change of capacity upon combination, this
compound should only have the capacity .618 ;
whereas, in fact, the mixture produces an in-
crease of temperature of about 180°, and
therefore ought to be found with a diminished
capacity, or one below .618. Were this fact
to be established, it would exhibit an inex-
plicable phenomenon, unless to those who
adopt the notion of free caloric and combined
caloric existing in the same body, or to speak
more properly, of caloric combined so as to
retain all its characteristic properties, and cae
lorie combined so as to lose the whole of them.
One error in this statement has already been
pointed out, in regard to the capacity of lime.
If we adopt the specific heat of lime to be
.80, and apply the theorem for the zero, we
shal] find it to be 15770° below the common
temperature, as deduced from the above data
so corrected.

I took a specimen of nitric acid of the spe-
cific gravity 1.2, and found, by repeated trials,
its specific heat to be .76 by weight. Into
4600 grains of this acid of 35° temperature,
in a thin flask, 657 grains of lime were gra-
dually dropped, and the mixture moderately
agitated ; in one or two minutes after 3-4ths of
the lime was in and dissolyed, the thermometer

--- Page 103 ---
GN THE ZERO OF TEMPERATURE. 9oL

rose nearly to 212°, and the mixture was be-
ginning to boil; it was suffered to cool 20°,
when the rest of the lime was added, and it
again rose to the boiling point; about 15
grains of insoluble residuum were left. These
were taken out, and their place supplied by
15 grains of fresh lime, which were dissolved,
and left a clear liquid nearly saturated, of
1.854 sp. gravity. The specific heat of this was
found to be .69. The increase of temperature
béing called 200°, and the specific heat of lime
being .30, we find the zero to be 11000° be-
low the freezing temperature. The experi-
ment was varied by taking acids of different
strengths, and various proportions of lime, but
the results still gave the zero more remote than
either of the previous methods. Perhaps the
reason may be that lime is still under-rated.

Combustion of Hydrogen.

Lavoisier finds the combustion of 1b. of
hydrogen to melt 295lbs. of ice. The results
of my experience give $20lbs, and Crawford’s
480.—Till this fact can be more accurately
ascertained, we may take 400ibs. as approxi-
mating to the truth. Or, which amounts to
the same thing, the combustion of Jb. of
hydrogén takes 7lbs. of oxygen, and gives out
heat which would raise 8tbs. of water 7500°.

--- Page 104 ---
92 ON THE ZERO OF TEMPERATURE,

By adopting Crawford’s capacities of hydro-
gen and oxygen, and applying the theorem,
page 58, we find the zero 1290° from the
common temperature. But if we adopt the
preceding theory of the specific heat of elastic
fluids, and apply the 4th corol. page 72, we
must conclude that in the formation of steam,
one half of the whole heat of both its eles
ments is given out ; the conversion of 8lbs of
steam into water, will give out heat sufficient
to melt 56lbs. of ice; therefore one half of the
whole heat in 1lb. of hydrogen, and “lbs. of
oxygen together, or which is the same thing,
the whole heat in 11b. ofhydrogen, or 7lbs. of
oxygen separately, will melt 344Ibs. of ice;
now if from 688 we take 400, there remain
288 for the lbs. of ice, which the heat in
8lbs. of water, at the ordinary temperature, is
sufficient to melt, or the heat in 11b. is capable
of melting 36lbs. of ice: hence the zero will
be 5400° below freezing water.

Combustion of Phosphorus.

One pound of phosphorus requires 121b. of
oxygen, and melts 66lbs. of ice. The specific
heat of phosphorus is not known; but from
analogy one may suppose it to have as much
heat as oil, wax, tallow, &c. which is nearly
half as much as water. From the last article

--- Page 105 ---
ON THE ZERO OF TEMPERATURE, 93

it seems, that the whole heat in each Ib. of oxy-
gen is sufficient to melt 50]bs. of ice; whence
the whole heat in both articles, previous to
combustion, is sufficient to melt 75 + 18
= 93lbs. of ice. From which deducting 66,
there remains 27 for the pounds of ice, which
the heat in 2.51bs. of phosphoric acid ought to
melt. This would give the specific heat of

that acid .30, a supposition not at all impro-
bable. The result of the combustion of phos-
phorus seems then to corroborate that from
hydrogen.

Combustion of Charcoal.

Crawford’s data are, specific heat of char-
coal .26, oxygen 4.749, carbonic acid 1.0454,
and the heat given out by burning 11b. of
charcoal = 69]bs. ice = 10350". It is now
established beyond doubt, that 11b. of charcoal
requires 2.6lbs. of oxygen to convert it into
carbonic acid. From these data, by the theo-
rem, page 58, we deduce the zero = 4400°—
But Crawford himself has not noticed this
deduction. If we adopt the theory of specific
heat, and the table founded on it, combined
with the supposition of the zero being 6000°
below the common temperature, (see pag 74)
we shall have from the general formula, this
equation,

--- Page 106 ---
94 ON THE ZERO OF TEMPERATU2L.

(1+ 2.6) X 491 X h

1X .26 $2.6 * 1.983 —— 3,6 X 491 = 9000"

where h represents the degrees of temperature
which the combustion of IIb. of charcoal
would raise the product, or 3.6lbs. of car-
bonic acid. From this, 4 is found = 6650".
But this heat would raise 3.6lbs. of water
= 6650 X .491 = 3265°. Or it would raise
1b. of water, 11750"; or it would melt 78lbs.
of ice. Lavoisier finds the effect = 96lbs.
and Crawford finds it = 69. So that the
supposed distance of the zero is not discoun-
tenanced by the combustion of charcoal, as
far as the theory is concerned.

Combustion of Oil, Wax and Tallow.

We do not know the exact cohstitution of
these compounds, nor the quantity of oxygen
which they require ; but from the experiments
of Lavoisier, as well as from some attempts
of my own, I am inclined to think, that they
are formed of about 5 parts of charcoal and 1
of hydrogen by weight, and that 6 parts re-
quire 21 of oxygen for their combustion, form-
ing 19 parts of carbonic acid and 8 of water.
Let it be supposed that the zero is 6900° be-
low freezing water, or that the heat in water
of 32°, is sufficient to melt 46lbs. of ice, then

--- Page 107 ---
ON THE ZERO OF TEMPERATURE, 95

the heat in steam will be sufficient to melt
53lbs. By applying Cor. 1, at page 72, we
shall find the heat in oxygenous gas = 60.5]bs.
amtl in carbonic acid, 22.3lbs. The heat in
1b. of oil, &c. equal to half that of water
= 28Ibs. which being added to 211.7, the
heat in 3.5lbs. of oxygen, gives 234.7Ibs. of
ice, whi¢h would be melted by all the heat
im Ub. of oil and 3.5 of oxygen ; but the pro-
ducts of combustion are 1.31. of water, and
$.2lbs. of carbonic acid, tagether containing as
much heat as would melt 131.2!bs, of ice ; this
being subtracted from 234.7, leaves 103.5 for
the ice to be melted by the heat evolved dur-
ing the combustion of 1b. of oil, wax or tal-
low, which agrees with the experiment. The
conclusion then supports the supposition, that
the zero is 6900” below freezing water.

Combustion of Ether, &c.

Thave pretty accurately ascertained the pro-
ducts of the combustion of 11b. of ether to be
1.75 water, and 2.25 carbonic acid, derived
from its union with lbs. of oxygea. By in-
stituting a calculation similar to the above,
but on the supposition of the zero being 6000°
below freezing water, I find the heat given
out on the combustion of ether, ought to be
= 67lbs. ofice : it was observed to be 62, and

--- Page 108 ---
96 ON THE ZERO OF TEMPERATURE.

the difference may well be attributed to the
loss unavoidable in my method of observa-
tion.

I might here enquire into the results of the
combustion of the other articles mentioned in
the table, page 78, as far as they affect the
present question; but I consider those above
noticed as the most to be depended upon.
From the result of olefiant gas we may learn,
that a combustible body in the gaseous state,
does not give out much more heat than when
in a liquid state ; for, oil and olefiant gas cer-
tainly do not differ much in their constitution ;
one would therefore have expected the same
weight of olefiant gas to have yielded more
heat than oil, because of the heat required to
maintain the elastic state; but it should seem
that the heat requisite to convert a liquid to
an elastic fluid, is but a small portion of the
whole, a conclusion evidently countenanced
by the experiments and observations contained
in the preceding pages.

It may be proper now to draw up the re-
sults of my experience, reported in the present
section, into one point of view.

The mean of all these is 6150°.. We are
authorised then, till something more decisive
appear, to consider the natural zero of tem-
perature as being about 6000° below the tem-
perature of freezing water, according to the
divisions of Fahrenheit’s scale. The differences
of the above results arc not greater than what
may be ascribed to inaccuracies, except the
2d and sth. I believe it will be impossible
to reconcile these two to each other, unless
it is upon the supposition of a change of capa-
city with change of temperature in one or
both of the mixtures. This deserves farther
enquiry.

Heat produced by Percussion and Frictio n

The heat produced by the percussion and
friction of solid bodies, arises from one and

--- Page 110 ---
98 ON THE ZERO OF TEMPERATURE.

the same cause, namely, from a condensation
of volume, and consequent diminution of
capacity of the excited body; exactly in the
same manner as the condensation of air pro-
duces heat. It is a well known fact, that iron
and other metals, by being hammered, be-
come hot and condensed in volume at the
same time; and if a diminution of capacity
has not been observed it is because it is small,
and has not been investigated with sufficient
accuracy. That a change of capacity actually
takes place cannot be doubted, when it is
considered, that a piece of iron once hammered
in this way, is unfitted for a repetition of the
effect, till it has been heated in a fire and
cooled gradually. Count Rumford has fur-
nished us with some important facts on the
production of heat by friction. He found that
in boring a cannon for 30 minutes, the tempe-
rature was raised 70°; and that it suffered a
loss of 837 grains by the dust, and scales torn
of, which amounted to 3, part of the cylin-
der. On the supposition that all the heat was
given out by these scales, he finds they must
have lost 66360° of temperature ; when at the
same time he found their specific heat not sen-
sibly diminished. But this is manifestly an
incorrect view of the subject: the heat excited
does not arise from the scales merely, else how

--- Page 111 ---
ON THE MOTION OF HEAT. 99

should hammering make a body red hot with-
out any loss of scales? ‘The fact is, the whole
mass of metal is more or less condensed by
the violence used in boring, and a rise of
temperature of 70 or 100° is too small to pro-
duce a sensible diminution in its capacity for
heat. Does Count Rumford suppose, that if
in this case the quantity of metal operated
upon had been 1lb. and the dust produced
the same as above, that the whole quantity of
heat evolved would have been the same ?

The phenomena of heat produced by fric-
tion and percussion, however, sufficiently shew
that the zero of temperature cannot be placed
at so small a distance as 1000° or 1500” below
the common temperature, as has been deter-
mined by some philosophers.

SECTION 7.

ON THE

MOTION AND COMMUNICATION
OF HEAT,
Arising from inequality of Temperature.
As from various sources the temperature of

bodies is liable to perpetual fluctuation, it
becomes of importance to determine the nature

--- Page 112 ---
100 ON THE MOTION OF HEAT.

cf the motion of heat in the same body, and
in its passage from one body to another, aris-
ing from its incessant tendency to an equili-
brium.

A solid bar being heated at one end, and
exposed to the air, the heat is partly dissipated
in the air, and partly conducted along the bar,
exhibiting a gradation of temperature from
the hot to the cold end. This power of
conducting heat varies greatly, according to
the nature of the subject: in general, metals,
and those bodies which are good conductors
of electricity, are likewise good conductors of
heat ; and vice versd.

When a fluid is heated at its surface, the
heat gradually and slowly descends in the
same manner as along a solid; and fluids seem
to have a difference in their conducting power
analogous to that of solids. But when the
heat is applied to the bottom of a vessel,
containing a fluid, the case is very different ;
the heated particles of the fluid, in conse-
quence of their diminished specific gravity,
form an ascending current and rise to the sur-
face, communicating a portion of heat in their
ascent to the contiguous particles, but still
retaining a superiority of temperature ; so that
the increase of temperature in the mass is first
observed at the surface, and is constantly

--- Page 113 ---
ON THE MOTION OF HEAT. 101

greatest there till the commencement of ebul-
lition in liquids, at which period the tempera-
ture is uniform. The conducting power of
fluids then arises from two distinct sources ; the
one is the same as in solids, namely, a gradual
progress of the heat from particle to particle,
exclusive of any motion of the particles them-
selves; the other arises from the internal mo-
tion of the particles of the fluid, by which the
extremes of hot and cold are perpetually
brought into contact, and the heat is thus dif-
fused with great celerity. The latter source
is so much more effectual than the former,
that some have been led, though without
sufficient reason, to doubt the existence of
the former, or that fluids do convey heat in the
same manner as solids.

Nothing appears, then, but that the com-
munication of heat from particle to particle, is
performed in the same way in fluids as in solids;
the rapidity of its diffusion in fluids, is to be
ascribed to an hydrostatical law. But there
is another method by which heat is propagated
through a vacuum, and through elastic fluids,
which demands our particular notice. By
this we receive the heat of the sun; and by
this, when in a room, we receive the heat of
an ordinary fire. Itis called the radiation of

--- Page 114 ---
102 ON THE MOTION OF HEAT.

heat ; and the heat, so propelled, is called ra-
diant heat.

Till lately we have been used to consider
the light and heat of the sun as the same
thing. But Dr. Herschel has shewn, that there
are rays of heat proceeding from the sun,
which are separable by a prism from the rays
of light; they are subject to reflection, like
light ; and to refraction, but in a less degree,
which is the cause of their separability from
light. The velocity of radiant heat is not
known; but it may be presumed to be the
same as that of light, till something appears
to the contrary. An ordinary fire, red hot
charcoal, or indeed any heated body, radiates
heat, which is capable of being reflected to a
focus, like the light and heat of the sun; but
it should seem to be not of sufficient energy
to penetrate glass, or other transparent bodies
so as to be refracted to an efficient focus.

Several new and important facts relative to
the radiation of heat, have lately been ascer-
tained by Professor Leslie, and published in
his “Enquiry on Heat.” Having invented
an ingenious and delicate air thermometer,
well adapted for the purpose, he was enabled
tomak the effects of radiation in a great
variety of cases and circumstances, with more
precision than had previously been done. Some

--- Page 115 ---
ON THE MOTION OF HEAT. 103

of the principal facts respecting the radiation
of heat, which have either been discovered or
confirmed by him, it will be proper to men-
tion.

1, If a given vessel be filled with hot water,
the quantity of heat which radiates from it,
depends chiefly upon the nature of the ex+
terior surface of the vessel. Thus, if a canis-
ter of tinned iron be the vessel, then a certain
quantity of heat radiates from it; if the said
vessel be covered with black paint, paper,
glass, &c. it will then radiate 8 times as much
heat in like circumstances.

2. If the bulb of the thermometer be cover-
ed with tinfoil, the impression of the radiant
heat is only 3th of that upon the glass sur-
face.

3, A metailic mirror reflects 10 times as
much heat from an ordinary fire, or from any
heated body, as a similar glass mirror does,
This last is found to reflect the heat from its
anterior surface, and not from the quicksilver-
ed one, which is the most essential in reflecting
solar light and heat. Here then is a strik~
ing difference between solar and culinary
heat.

From these facts it appears, that metals
and other bodies which are eminently dispos-
ed to reflect radiant heat, are not disposed to

--- Page 116 ---
104 ON THE MOTION OF HEAT.

absorb it in any remarkable degree ; whereas,
black paint, paper, glass, &c. are disposed to
absorb it, and consequently to radiate it again
in proper circumstances.

4. Screens of glass, paper, tinfoil, &c. being
placed between the radiating body and the
reflector, were proved to intercept the radiant
heat completely ; but being heated themselves
by the direct radiant heat, in time the ther-
mometer was affected by their radiation. —
The heat radiating from hot water, does not
then seem capable of being transmitted through
glass, like the solar heat.

5. Radiant heat suffers no sensible loss in its
passage through the air; a greater or less
radiant body produces the same effect, pro-
vided it subtends the same angle at the re-
flector, agreeing with light in this respect.

6. The intensity of reflected heat diminishes
inversely as the distance; whereas, in light,
it is the same at all distances; the focus of
heat too differs from that of light; it is nearer
the reflector; the heating effect diminishes
rapidly in going outwards, but slowly in go-
ing inwards towards the reflector—This seems
to intimate the want of perfect elasticity in
radiant heat.

7. A hollow globe of tin, four inches in
diameter, being filled with hot water, cooled

--- Page 117 ---
ON THE MOTION OF HEAT. 105

from 35° to 25° centigrade in 156 minutes; the
same painted with lamp-black, cooled from
35° to 25° in 81 minutes. The air of the room
was 15°.

8. When a heated body is whirled through
the air, the additional cooling effect is directly
proportional to the velocity.

9. In air the rate of cooling of a hollow
glass globe filled with hot water, and that of
the same globe covered with tinfoil, is not con-
stant at all temperatures. ‘fhe disproportion
is greater in low temperatures, and less in
high. Thus, in the present case, Mr. Leslie
finds the variable ratio to be as 105 + h for
glass, and as 50 + h for tin, where h repre-
sents the elevation of temperature in degrees.
According to this the rate of cooling of a
vitreous and a metallic surface is nearly the
same at very high temperatures ; but is nearly
as 105 to 50, when A is very little —No dif-
ferences are observed in their rates of cooling
in water.

10. After a long and intricate, but ingenious
investigation, Mr. Leslie finds the cooling
power of the air upon a hollow sphere, six
inches in diameter, and filled with boiling
water, to be as follows: namely, in each
minute of time the fluid loses the following

--- Page 118 ---
106 ON THE MOTION OF HEAT,

fractional parts of its excess of temperature,
by the three distinct sources of refrigeration in
the air undermentioned :

By abduction, that is, the proper conduct-
ing power of air, the 524th.

By recession, that is, the perpendicular cur-
rent of air excited by the heated body, the
h Xx 21715th.

By pulsation, or radiation, the 2533d part
from a metalic surface, and eight times as
much, or the 317th part from a surface of
paper; (It should be observed, that Mr. Les-
lie contends that air is instrumental in the ra-
diation of heat, which is contrary to the re-
ceived opinion.)

11. A body cools more slowly in rarefied
air, than in air of the common density : and
the different species of air have their respective
refrigerating powers. Common air and hydro-
genous gas exhibit remarkable differences. Ac-
cording to Mr. Leslie, if the cooling power
of common air upon a vitreous surface be de-
noted by unity, that of hydrogenous gas will
be denoted by 2,2857; and upon a metallic
surface the ratio is .5 to 1.7857. In common
air the loss ftom a vitreous surface is .57 by ra-
diation, and .43 by the other two causes : from
a metallic surface, .07 and .48. In hydroge-
nous gas the loss from a vitreous surface is .57

by radiation, and 1.71 by the other causes ;
from a metallic surface, 07 and 1.71.—He finds
the radiation to be the same in the two gases,
and to be very little diminished by rarefac-
tion ; but the effects of the other refrigerating
powers rapidly diminish with the density.

Those who wish to see the experiments
and reasonings from which these important
conclusions are derived, must have recourse to
Mr. Leslie’s work: but as some of the facts
and opinions appear from my experience to be
questionable, I shall now proceed to state
what has occurred to me on these subjects. —
Ihave no reason to withhold my assent from
the first 8 articles; but the last 3 are not
equally satisfactory.

Before we enter upon a detail of experi-
ments, it will be proper to point out the cor-
respondence of the new thermometric scale
with the old one in the higher parts, it being
only given briefly in the table, page 14.

Experiment 1.

A mercurial thermometer having a bulb of
half an in inch in diameter, and a scale of
about 8 inches long from freezing to boiling
mercury, was heated to 442° new scale, and
suffered to cool ina horizontal position in air
of 42°. The bulb in this and every other in-
strument projected several inches below the
scale. The times of cooling were the same
from 442° to 212°, from 242° to 142°, and from
142° to 92", namely, 2 minutes and 20 seconds
each. ‘This was often repeated ; the times of
cooling were always within 4 or 5 seconds of
that above, and when any differences in the

--- Page 121 ---
ON THE MOTION OF HEAT. 109

successive intervals took place, the times were
always observed to be rather less in the higher,
and more in the lower parts of the scale.

From this experiment it appears, that the
thermometer was raised 400° above the tem-
perature of the air, or to 600° of the old scale ;
it lost 200° of temperature in the first interval
of time, 100° in the second, and 50°in the
third. This result goes to establish the prin-
ciple announced at page 12, that, according
tothe new graduation, the temperature descends
in geometrical progression to equal increments
of time.

Experiment 2.

According to Mr. Leslie, the same law of
cooling does not take place from a metallic
as from a vitreous surface ; this always ap-
peared to me very surprising, and I was
anxious to satisfy myself more particularly as
to the fact. With this view, I took another
mercurial thermometer, with a bulb of .7 inch
diameter, and scale of 12 inches, having a
range from O to 300° old scale, and corres-
ponding new scale attached to it. ‘This was
heated, and the times of cooling through every
successive 10 degrees of the new scale were
noticed repeatedly ; the bulb was then covered

with tinfoil, pasted upon it, and the surface
made as smooth as well could be ; the ther-
mometer was then heated, and the times of
cooling were again noticed as before, re-
peatedly. The mean results follow ; and a

thermometer was raised to 275° per scale; that
is, 235° above the air, and it is obviously most
convenient to reckon from the temperature of
the air considered as zero: in which case 19

By inspecting this table, it appears that the
whole time of cooling when the bulb was
clear was 851 seconds. and when covered
with tinfoil was 1206 seconds, which numbers
are nearly as 17 to 24. But the times in
cooling from 175° to 165° were 17 and 24 se-
conds respectively ; and the times in cooling
from 95° to 85° were 34 and 48 respec-
tively, which are exactly in the ratio of the
whole times: and by examining any two cor-
responding times, they will be found to be as
17 to 24 nearly. Whence it follows that the
same Jaw of progressive cooling applies to a
metallic as to a vitreous surface, contrary to
the results of Mr. Leslie’s experience. It
must not however be understood that this
ratio for the two kinds of surfaces is quite
correct ; however carefully the bulb of a ther-
mometer may be coated with tinfoil, the sur-
face is necessarily enlarged, which makes it
cool more quickly than if the metallic surface
were the very same quantity as the vitreous.

The differences of the logarithms happening
accidentally so nearly to coincide in magtitude
with the times of cooling of the metallic sur-
face, they require no reduction, and we Have
an opportunity of seeing how far the law of
geometrical progression in cooling is supported
by this experiment. ft appears that for 5 or 6

of the highest intervals of temperature, the
times of cooling were rather smaller, and for
the two last rather larger than required by
the law.

Experiment 3.

As Mr, Leslie found the times of cooling
of metallic surfaces considerably enlarged, in
moderate elevations of temperature more es-
pecially, I took another thermometer having
a smaller bulb, and a scale of an inch for 10
degrees, this was treated as in the last experi.
ment, and the results were as under :

They very nearly accord too with the logarith-
mic ratios. The effect of the metallic sur-
face differs less from that of the vitreous in

this than in the former experiment; because
the bulb being smailer, it was more than pro-
portionally increased in surface by the tinfoil,
which was pasted on in small slips, and conse-
quently was twofold in many places.

Being from these results pretty well satisfied
that the surfaces of bodies do not disturb the
law of their refrigeration, though they ma-
terially affect the time, yet in consequence of
the general accuracy of Mr. Leslie’s experi-
ments, I was desirous to ascertain the results in
his own way, more particularly because for the
reason assigned above, my method did not give
the true rates of cooling of equal surfaces.

Experiment 4.

T took two new tin canisters, such as are
commonly used for tea, of a cylindtico-conical
shape, and each capable of holding 15 oz. of
water. The surface of one of them was co-
vered with brown paper pasted on it; instead
of the usual lid, a cork of 1+ inch. diameter
was adapted to both, and through a hole in
the centre of this, the tube of a delicate ther-
mometer was inserted, with ascale of the new
graduation affixed above the cork. Both
canisters were contrived to be suspended by
small strings when filled with water, and to

have the thermometer with its bulb in thelr
centers. They were successively filled with
boiling water, and suspended in the middle of
a room of the temperature 40°, and the times of
cooling through each successive 10 degrees
were noticed as below.

Here the results are equally satisfactory and
important ; not only the times of cooling are
in the uniform ratio of 2 to 3 throughout the
range; but they almost exactly accord with
the logarithmic ratios, indicating the geometric
progression in cooling. As experiments of
this sort are capable of being repeated by any
one without the aid of any expensive instru-
ment or any extraordinary dexterity ; it will

--- Page 127 ---
ON THE MOTION OF HEAT, 115

be unnecessary to insist upon the accuracy of
the above. It will be understood that the
range of cooling was from 205° of the new
scale, to 65° of the same, the air being 40°, or
25° below the extremity of the range, which
corresponds with 57° of the old scale.

It will be proper now to enquire into thé
cause of the difference in the times of cooling
arising from the variation of surface. Mr.
Leslie has shewn the surface has no influence
upon the time of cooling when immersed in
water ; it should seem then that the difference
of surfaces in the expenditure of heat arises
from their different powers of radiation solely ;
indeed Leslie has proved by direct experiments
that the heat radiating from a vitreous or pa-
per surface is 8 times as great as that from a
metallic surface. Taking this for granted, we
can easily find the portions of heat dispersed by
radiation, and conducted away by the atmos-
phere. For, let 1 denote the quantity of heat
conducted away by the atmosphere, from a
vitreous or metallic surface in any given small
portion of time, and z the quantity radiated
from a metallic surface in the same time; then
8z will be the quantity radiated from a vitreous
surface in that time; and from the result of
the last experiment we shall have, 2: 3 :: Pee
1 4+ 8x; whence 2 + l6r = 3 + 3x, and

v= 55; this gives 1 34, for the whole heat
discharged by metal, and 1,4, for that dis-
charged by glass in the same time, where the
unit expresses the part conducted, and the
fraction the part radiated.

That is, from a metallic surface 13 parts of
heat are conducted away by the air and 1 part
radiated ; from a vitreous surface 13 parts
are conducted, and 8 parts radiated, in a given
time.

The quantity of heat discharged by radia-
tion from the most favourable surface, there-
fore, is probably not more than .4 of the whole,
and that conducted away by the air not less
than .6.—Mr. Leslie however deduces .57 for
the former, and .43 for the latter ; because he
found the disproportion in the times of cooling
of vitreous and metallic surfaces greater than
I find it in the lower part of the scale.

The obvious consequences of this doctrine
in a practical sense are,

1. In every case where heat is required to
be retained as long as possible, the containing
vessel should be of metal, with a bright clear
surface.

2. Whenever heat is required to be given
out by a body with as much celerity as pos-
sible, the containing vessel, if of metal, ought
to be painted, covered with paper, char-

coal, or some animal or vegetable matter; in
which case the heat given out will be 3 parts
for 2 from a metallic surface.

Refrigeration of Bodies in various Kinds of
Elastic Fluids.

Bodies cool in very different times in some
of the elastic fluids. Mr. Leslie was the first,
I believe, who noticed this fact; and he has
given us the results of his experiments on com-
mon air and hydrogenous gas, of the common
density, and also rarefied in various degrees.—
I made some experiments with a view to de-
termine the relative cooling powers of the
gases, the results of which it may be proper to
give. My apparatus was a strong phial, con-
taining about 15 or 20 cubic inches; a per-
forated cork containing the stem of a ther-
mometer was adapted to it, so as to be air
tight; two marks were made with a file on
the tube of the thermometer, comprizing an
interval of 15 or 20°, about blood heat. The
bottle was filled with any proposed gas, and
after it had acquired the temperature of the
surrounding air, the stopper was withdrawn,
and the heated thermometer with its cork was
instantly inserted; the number of seconds

from the upper to the under mark were then
noted, as under. The surrounding air wasofa

The refrigerating effect of hydrogen is truly
remarkable; I cooled the thermometer 10
times successively in a bottle of hydrogen gas ;
at each experiment the instrument was taken
out, and the stopper put in, till the original
temperature was restored; by this, a portion
of the hydrogen escaped each time, and an
equal portion of common air was admitted ;
the times of cooling regularly increased as
follows; viz. 40, 43, 46, 48, 51,53, 56, 58,
60 and 62 seconds, respectively ; at this time
the mixture was examined, and found half
hydrogen and half common air. Equal
measures of hydrogen and common air were


--- Page 131 ---
ON THE MOTION OF HEAT. 9

then mixed together, and put into the bat-
tle, and the heated thermometer was found
to cool from mark ta mark, in 62 seconds as
before.

Condensed air cools bodies more rapidly
than air of common density ; and rarefied air
less rapidly, whatever be the kind.—The re-
sults of my own experience for common air
were as follows :

A small receiver of hydrogen gas, which
cooled the thermometer in 40 seconds, when
rarefied 7 or 8 times, took 70 seconds to cool
the same. But the exact effects of rarefaction
on this and the other gases were not deter-
mined.

From Mr. Leslie, we learn that in hydro-
genous gas, there is little difference between
thetime of cooling of a vitreous and metallic
surface, the former being as 2.28, and the lat-

ter as 1.78, from which he justly infers “ this
inequality of effect [between atmospheric air
and hydrogenous gas] proves its influence to
be exerted chiefly, if not entirely, in augment-
ing the abductive portion.”

The expenditure of heat by radiation being
the same in hydrogenous gas as in atmospheric
air, we may infer it is the same in every other
species of gas; and therefore is performed in-
dependently of the gas, and is carried on the
same in vacuo as in air. Indeed Mr, Leslie
himself admits that the diminution of the
effect consequent upon rarefaction is extremely
small, which can scarcely be conceived if air
were the medium of radiation.

The effect of radiation being allowed con-
stant, that of the density of the air may be
investigated, and will be found, I believe, to
vary nearly or accurately as the cube root of the
density. In order to compare this hypothesis
with observation, let 100 = time of cooling in
atmospheric air, the density being 1; then
from what has been said above,.4 will represent
the heat lost by a vitreous surface by radiation,
and .6 that lost by the conducting power of
the medium. Let ¢ = the time of cooling in
air of the density d; then if 100: .4 :: ¢: .004
t= the heat lost by radiation ; but the heat

This table accords nearly with the preceding
one, the result of actual observation.—In the
same way might the times of cooling of a me-
tallic surface in rarefied air be found, by sub-
stituting .0007 for .004, and .0093 for .006 in
the preceding formula.

The cooling power of hydrogenous gas in-
dependent of radiation, may be found thus:

if 100”: .4 :: 40” : .16 = the heat lost by
radiation in that gas in 40 seconds ; whence
.84 = the heat conducted away by the air in
40”, or .021 per second ; but in common air
the loss per second by abduction is only .006 ;
from this it appears that the refrigerating
power of hydrogenous gas is 34 times as great
as that of common air.

It may be asked what is the cause why dif-
ferent gases have such different cooling effects,
especially on the supposition of each atom of
all the different species possessing the same
quantity of heat? To this we may answer
that the gases differ from each other in two
essential points, in the number of atoms in a
given volume, and in the weight or inertia of
their respective atoms. Now both number and
weight tend to retard the motion of a current :
that is, if two gases possess the same number
of particles in a given volume, it is evident that
one will disperse heat most quickly which has
its atoms of the least weight; and if other
two gases have particles of the same weight,
that one will most disperse heat which has the
least number in a given volume; because the
resistance will be as the number of particles to
be moved, in like circumstances. Of the
gases that have nearly the same number of
particles in the same volume, are, hydrogen,

--- Page 135 ---
ON THE TEMPERATURE, &c. 123

carburetted hydrogen, sulphuretted hydrogen,
nitrous oxide, and carbonic acid. These con-
duct heat in the order they are written, hy-
drogen best and carbonic acid worst; and the
weights of their ultimate particles increase in
the same order (see page 73). Of those that
have their atoms of the same weight and
their number in a given volume different, are
oxygen and carburetted hydrogen: the latter
has the greater cooling power and the fewer
particles in a given volume.

SECTION 8,

ON THE TEMPERATURE OF THE
ATMOSPHERE.

Ttisa remarkable fact, and has never, I be-
lieve, been satisfactorily accounted for, that the
atmosphere in all places and seasons is found
to decrease in temperature in proportion as
we ascend, and nearly in an arithmetical
progression. Sometimes the fact may have
been otherwise, namely, that the air was
colder at the surface of the earth than above,
particularly at the breaking of a frost, I have
observed itso; but this is evidently the effect

--- Page 136 ---
124 ON THE TEMPERATURE

of great and extraordinary commotion in the
atmosphere, and is at most of a very short
duration. What then is the occasion of this
diminution of temperature in ascending ? Be-
fore this question can be solved, it may be pro-
per to consider the defects of the common
solution—Air, it is said, is not heated by the
direct rays of the sun; which pass through it
as a transparent medium, without producing
any calorific effect, till they arrive at the sur-
face of the earth. The earth being heated,
communicates a portion to the contiguous at-
mosphere, whilst the superior strata in pro-
portion as they are more remote, receive less
heat, forming a gradation of temperature,
similar to what takes place along a bar of iron
when one of its ends is heated.

The first part of the above solution is pro-
bably correct: Air, it should seem, is singular
in regard to heat ; it neither receives nor dis-
charges it in a radiant state ; if so, the propaga-
tion of heat through air must be effected by its
conducting power, the same as in water.
Now we know that heat applied to the under
surface of a column of water is propagated
upwards with great celerity, by the actual
ascent of the heated particles: it is equally
certain too that heated air ascends. From
these observations it should follow that the

--- Page 137 ---
OF THE ATMOSPHERE. 125

causes assigned above for the gradual change
of temperature in a perpendicular column of
the atmosphere, would apply directly to a
state of temperature the very reverse of the
fact; namely, to one in which the higher the
ascent or the more remote from the earth the
higher should be the temperature.

Whether this reasoning be correct or not, it
must I think be universally allowed, that the
fact has not hitherto received a satisfactory
explanation. I conceive it to be one involving
a new principle of heat; by which I mean a
principle that no other phenomenon of nature
presents us with, and which is not at present
recognized as such. I shall endeavour in what
follows to make out this position.

The principle is this: The natural equili-
brium of heat.in an atmosphere, is when
each atom of air in the same perpendicular
column is possessed of the same quantity of
heat ; and consequently, the natural equili-
brium of heat in an atmosphere is when the
temperature gradually diminishes in ascending.

That this is a just consequence cannot be
denied, when we consider that air increases in
its capacity for heat by rarefaction : when the
quantity of heat is given or limited, therefore
the temperature must be regulated by the
density.

--- Page 138 ---
126 ON THE TEMPERATURE

It is an established principle that any body
on the surface of the earth unequally heated is
observed constantly to tend towards an equality
of temperature ; the new principle announced
above, seems to suggest an exception to this
law. But if it be examined, it can scarcely
appear in that light. Equality of heat and
equality of temperature, when applied to the
same body in the same state, are found so
uniformly to be associated together, that we
scarcely think of making any distinction be-
tween the two expressions. No one would
object to the commonly observed law being
expressed in these terms: When any body is
unequally heated, the equilibrium is found to
be restored when each particle of the body
becomes in possession of the same quantity of
heat. Now the law thus expressed is what I
apprehend to be the true general law, which
applies to the atmosphere as well as to other
bodies. It is an equality of heat, and not an
equality of temperature that nature tends to
restore.

The atmosphere indeed presents a striking
peculiarity to us in regard to heat : we see in
a perpendicular column of air, a body without
any change of form, slowly and gradually
changing its capacity for heat from a less

--- Page 139 ---
OF THE ATMOSPHERE. 127

to a greater; but all other bodies retain a
uniform capacity throughout their substance.

Tf it be asked why an equilibrium of heat
should turn upon the equality in quantity rather
than in temperature ; I answer that I do not
know: but I rest the proof of it upon the fact
of the inequality of temperature observed in
ascending into the atmosphere. If the natural
tendency of the atmosphere was to an equality
of temperature, there does not appear to me
any reason why the superior regions of the
air should not be at least as warm as the
inferior.

The arguments already advanced on behalf
of the priaciple we are endeavouring to
establish, are powerfully corroborated by the
following facts:—By the observations of
Bouguer, Saussure, and Gay Lussac, we find
that the temperature of the air at an elevation
where its weight is + that at the surface, is
about 50° Fahrenheit less than that at the sur-
face: and from my experiments (Manch,
Mem. vol. 5. page 525.) it appears that air
being suddenly rarefied from 2 to 1 produces
50° of cold. Whence we may infer, that a
measure of air at the earth’s surface being
taken up to the height above-mentioned, pre-
serving its original temperature, and suffered
to expand, would become two measures, and be

--- Page 140 ---
128 ON THE TEMPERATURE

reduced to the same temperature as the sur-
rounding air ; or vice, versa, if two measures
of air at the proposed height were condensed
into one measure, their temperature would be
raised 50°, and they would become the same in
density and temperature, as the like volume of
air at the earth’s surface. In like manner we
may infer, that if a volume of air from the
earth’s surface, to the summit of the atmo-
sphere were condensed and brought imo a
horizontal position on the earth’s surface, it
would become of the same density and tem-
perature as the air around it, without receiving
or parting with any heat whatever.

Another important argument in favour of
the theory here proposed may be derived from
the contemplation of an atmosphere of vapour.
Suppose the present aerial atmosphere were to
be annihilated, and one of steam or aqueous
vapour were substituted in its place ; and sup-
pose further, that the temperature of this at-
mosphere at the earth’s surface were every
where 212° and its weight equal to 30 inches
of mercury. Now at the elevation of about
6 miles the weight would be 15 inches or
} of that below, at 12 miles, it would be
7.5 inches, or + of that at the surface, &c. and
the temperature would probably diminish 25°
at each of those intervals. It could not di-

OP THE ATMOSPHERE, 129

minish more; for we have seen (page 14) that
a diminution of temperature of 25° reduces
the force of vapour one half; if therefore a
greater reduction of temperature were to take
place, the weight of the incumbent atmosphere
would condense a portion of the vapour into
water, and the general equilibrium would
thus be disturbed perpetually from condensa-
tions in the upper regions. But if we suppose
on the other hand, that the diminution of tem-
perature in each of these intervals is less than
25°, then the upper regions could admit of
more vapour without condensation ; but it must
take place at the surface, because vapour at
212° cannot sustain more than the weight of
30 inches of mercury.

These three supposed cases of an aqueous
vapour atmosphere may be otherwise stated
thus :

1, The specific gravity of steam at the earth’s
surface being supposed .6 of atmospheric air,
and the weight of the atmosphere of steam
equal to 30 inches of mercury, its temperature
at the surface would be 212°; at 6 miles
high, 187°; at 12 miles, 162°; at 18 miles,
137°; at 24 miles, 112°, &c.—In this case the
density, not only at the surface, but every
where, would be a maximum, or the greatest
possible for the existing temperature ; so that

--- Page 142 ---
130 ON THE TEMPERATURE

a perfect equilibrium having once obtained.
there could be neither condensation nor eva-
poration in any region. For every 400 yards
of elevation, the thermometer would descend
1 degree.

2. If the atmosphere were constituted just
as above, except that the temperature now
diminished more rapidly than at the rate of
25° for 6 miles ; then the temperature of the
higher regions not being sufficient to support
the weight, a condensation must take place ;
the weight would thus be diminished, but as
the temperature at the surface is always sup-
posed to be kept at 212°, evaporation must go
on there with the design to keep up the pres-
sure at 30 inches, Thus there would be per-
petual strife between the recently raised vapour
ascending, and the condensed drops of rain
descending. A position much less likely than
the preceding one.

3. The same things being supposed as be-
fore, but now the temperature decreases more
slowly than at the rate of 25° for 6 miles: in
this case the density of the steam at the earth’s
surface would be a maximum for the tempera-
ture, but no where else ; so that ifa quantity of
water were taken up to any elevation it would
evaporate; but the increased weight of the
atmosphere would produce a condensation of

--- Page 143 ---
OF THE ATMOSPHERE. 131

steam into water on the ground. In this case
then there would not be that equilibrium,
which we see in the Ist case, and which ac-
cords so much more with the regularity and
simplicity generally observable in the laws of
nature.*

* Lowe to Mr. Ewart the first hint of the idea respect-
ing elastic fluids, which I have endeavoured to expand
in the present section; he suggested to me some time ago,
that it was probable steam of any low temperature, as 32°,
of maximum density, contained the same quantity of ab-
solute heat as the like weight of steam of 212° of maximum
density ; and that consequently if it could be gradually
compressed without losing any heat, that is, if the con-
taing vessel kept pace with it in increase of temperature,
there would never be any condensation of steam into water,
but it would constantly retain its elasticity.

In fact the heat (1000°), which is given out by steam
when it is condensed into water, is merely heat of com-
pression; there is nochange in the affinity of the molecules
of water for heat; the expulsion is occasioned solely by
the approximation of the molecules, and would be precisely
the same whether that approximation was occasioned by ex-
ternal compression or internal attraction. Indeed ifwe estimate
the temperature that would be given out by the mechanical
compression of steam from a volume of 2048 to that of 1, by
successively doubling the density, and supposing as above,
that at each time of doubling, 25° were given out, it
would be found that 12 successive operations would reduce
the volume to 4, aud that only 300° would be given out,
But it is not right to conclude, that the same quantity of
temperature would be given out at each of the successive

--- Page 144 ---
132 ON THE TEMPERATURE, &c.

That an atmosphere of steam does actually
surround the earth, existing independently of
the other atmospheres with which however it
is necessarily most intimately mixed, is I think
capable of demonstration. I have endeavoured
to enforce and illustrate it in several Essays in
the Memoirs of the Manchester Society, and
in Nicholson’s Journal, to which I must refer.
Now an atmosphere of any elastic fluid,
whether of the weight of 30 inches of mer-
cury, or of half an inch, must observe the same
general laws; but it should seem that an
atmosphere of vapour varies its temperature

condensations, though it may be nearly so for most of them :
towards the conclusion, the space occupied by the solid
atom or particle bears a considerable propostion to the whole
epace occupied by it and its atmosphere. At the first com-
pression, the atmosphere of heat might be said to be re-
duced into half the space ; but at the last, the reduction
would be much greater, and therefore mere heat given out
than determined by theory.

Since writing the above, Mr. Ewart informs me that the
idea respecting steam, which I had from him, is originally
Mr. Watt’s. In Black’s Lectures, Vol. 1, page 190, the
author, speaking of Mr. Watt’s experiments on steam at
low temperatures, observes, “ we find that the latent heat
of the steam is at least as much inereased as the sensible
heat is diminished.” It is wonderful that so remarkable a
fact should have been so long known and so little noticed.

--- Page 145 ---

less rapidly in ascending than the one we have
of air. Something of an effect similar to what
is pointed out in the 2d case above, ought
therefore to be observed in our mixed at-
mosphere ;—namely, a condensation of vapour
in the higher regions, at the same moment
that evaporation is going on below.—This is
actually the case almost every day, as all know
from their own observation ; a cloudy stratum
of air frequently exists above, whilst the
region below is comparatively dry.

SECTION 9,

ON THE PHENOMENA OF THE CON-
GELATION OF WATER.

Several remarkable phenomena are attend-
ant upon the congelation of water, and some
of them are so different from what might be
expected from analogy, that I believe no ex-
planation according with the principles of the
mechanical philosophy has been attempted,
such as to account for all the appearances.
This attempt is the object of the present
Essay. It willbe expedient previously to state
the principal facts.

--- Page 146 ---
134 ON CONGELATION.

1. The specific gravity of ice is less than that
of water in the ratio of 92 to 100.

2. When water is exposed in a large sus-
pended jar to cool in still air of 20 or 30°, it
may be cooled 2 or 3° below freezing ; but if
any tremulous motion take place, there appear
instantly a multitude of shining hexangular
spicula, floating, and slowly ascending in the
water.

3. It is observed that the shoots or ramifica-
tions of ice at the commencement, and in the
early stage of congelation are always at an
angle of 60 or 120°.

4. Heat is given out during congelation, as
much as would raise the temperature of water
150° of the new scale. The same quantity is
again taken in when the ice is melted. This
quantity may be ,*5 of the whole heat which
water of 32° contains.

5. Water is densest at 36° of the old scale,
or 38° of the new: from that point it gradu-
ally expands by cooling or by heating alike,
according to the law so often mentioned, that
of the square of the temperature.

6. If water be exposed to the air, and to
agitation, it cannot be cooled below 32°; the
application of cold freezes a part of the water,
and the mixture of ice and water requires the
temperature of 32°,

--- Page 147 ---
ON CONGELATION. 185

7. If the water be kept still, and the cold be
not severe, it may be cooled in large quantities
to 25° or below, without freezing ; if the water
be confined in the bulb of a thermometer, it is
very difficult to freeze it by any cold mixture
above 15° of the old scale; but it is equally
difficult to cool the water much below that
temperature without its freezing. I have ob-
tained it as low as 7 or 8°, and gradually heated
it again without any part of it being frozen.

8. In the last case of what may be called
forced cooling, the law of expansion is still
observed as given above,

9. When water is cooled to 15° or below in
a bulb, it retains the most perfect transparency ;
but if it accidentally freeze, the congelation
is instantaneous, the bulb becoming in a mo-
ment opake and white like snow, and the
water is projected up the stem.

10, When water is cooled below freezing,
and congelation suddenly takes place, the tem-
perature rises instantly to 32°.

In order to explain these phenomena, let it
be conceived that the ultimate or smallest ele-
ments of water are all globular, and exactly
of the same size ; let the arrangement of these
atoms be in squares, as exhibited in Fig. 1.
Plate 3. so that each particle touches four others
in the same horizontal plane. Conceive a second

--- Page 148 ---
136 ON CONGELATION.

stratum of particles placed upon these in like
order of squares, but so that each globule falls
into the concavity of four others on the first
stratum, and consequently rests upon four
points, elevated 45° above the centres of the
globules. A perpendicular section of such
globule resting upon two diagonal globules of
the square is exhibited in Fig. 3. Conceive
a third stratum placed in like manner upon the
second, &c, The whole being similar to a
square pile of shot.—The above constitution
is conceived to represent that of water at the
temperature of greatest density.

To find the number of globules in a cubic
vessel, the side of which is given ; let n= the
number of particles in one line or side of the
cube ; then n* is the number in any horizontal
stratum ; and because a line joining the centres
of two contiguous particles in different strata
makes an angle of 45° with the horizontal
plane, the number of strata in the given
height will be 2 + sine of 45° = n+ iv2.
Whence the number of particles in the cubic
vessel = 28 +iV2 = nV.

Now let it be supposed that the square pile
is instantly drawn into the shape of a rhombus
(Fig2.) ; then each horizontal stratum will still
consist of the same number of particles as be-
fore, only in a more condensed form, each

--- Page 149 ---
ON CONGELATION. 137

particle being now in contact with six others.
But to counteract this condensation, the se-
veral successive strata are more elevated than
before, so that the pile is increased in height.
A question then arises whether a vessel of
given capacity will hold a greater number of
particles in this or the former disposition? It
must be observed, that in the last case, each
particle of a superior stratum rests only on two
particles of an inferior one, and is therefore
elevated by the sine of 60° as represented in
Fig. 4. The bases of the two piles are as
1: v2, and their heights as 7+: y3 but the
capacities are as the products of the base and
height, oras y+: 3; that is, as .707 to .750
nearly, or as 94 to 100, Thus it appears that
the first arrangement contains more particles
in a given space than the second by 6 per
cent.

The last or rhomboidal arrangement is sup-
posed to be that which the particles of water
assume upon congelation. The specific gra-
vities of ice and water should therefore be as
94 to 100, But it should be remembered
that water usually contains 2 per cent. in bulk
of atmospheric air : and that this air is liberated
upon congelation ; and is commonly entangled
amongst the ice in such sort as to increase ils
bulk without materially increasing its weight ;

--- Page 150 ---
138 ON CONGELATION.

this reduces the specific gravity of ice 2 per
cent. or makes it 92, which agrees exactly
with observation. Hence the Ist fact is ex-
plained.

The angle of a rhombus is 60°, and its sup-
plement 120°; if any particular angles are
manifested in the act of congelation, therefore
we ought to expect these, agreeable to the
2d and 3d phenomena.

Whenever any remarkable change in the
internal constitution of any body takes place,
whether by the accession and junction of new
particles, or by new arrangements of those
already existing in it; some modification in
the atmospheres of heat must evidently be re-
quired ; though it may be difficult to estimate
the quantity, and sometimes even the kind of
change so produced, as in the present case.
So far therefore the theory proposed agrees
with the 4th phenomenon.

In order to explain the other phenomena, it
will be requisite to consider more particularly
the mode by which bodies are expanded by
heat.—Is the expansion occasioned simply by
the enlargement of the individual atmospheres
of the component particles? This is the case
with elastic fluids, and perhaps with solids,
but certainly not with liquids. How is it pos-
sible that water should be expanded a portion

--- Page 151 ---
ON CONGELATION. 139

represented by 1 upon the addition of a cer-
tain quantity of heat at one temperature, and
by 340 upon the addition of a like quantity at
another temperature, when both temperatures
are remote from the absolute zero, the one
perhaps 6000° and the other 6170°? The
fact cannot be accounted for on any other sup-
position than that of a change of arrangement
in the component particles ; and a gradual
change from the square to the rhomboidal ar-
rangement is in all probability effected both
by the addition and abstraction of heat. It is to
be supposed then that water of the greatest
possible density has its particles arranged in
the square form ; but if a given quantity of
heat be added to, or taken from it, the par-
ticles commence their approach to the rhom-
boidal form, and consequently the whole is
expanded, and that the same by the same
change of temperature, whether above or
below that point.

If heat be taken away from water of 38°,
then expansion is the consequence, and a mo-
derate inclination of the particles towards the
thomboidal form; but this only extends a
small way whilst the mass is subject to a
tremulous motion, so as to relieve the obstruc-
tions occasioned by friction; by the energ
of certain affinities, the new form is completed

--- Page 152 ---
140 ON CONGELATION.

in moment, and a portion of ice formed ; heat
is then given out which retards the subsequent
formation, till at last the whole is congealed.
This is the ordinary process of congelation.
But if the mass of water cooled is kept in a
state of perfect tranquillity, the gradual ap-
proach to the rhombvidal form can be carried
much farther ; the expansion goes on accord-
ing to the usual manner, and the slight friction
or adhesion of the particles is sufficient to
counteract the balance of energies in favour of
the new formation, till some accidental tremor
contributes to adjust the equilibrium. A
similar operation is performed when we lay a
piece of iron on a table, and hold a magnet
gradually nearer and nearer ; the proximity of
the approach, without contact, is much assisted
by guarding against any tremulous motion of
the table. Hence the rest of the phenomena
are accounted for.

CHAP. If

ON THE

CONSTITUTION OF BODIES.

Tuere are three distinctions in the kinds of
bodies,orthree states, which have more especially
claimed the attention of philosophical chemists;
namely, those which are marked by the terms
elastic fluids, liquids, and solids. A very fa-
miliar instance is exhibited to us in water, of
a body, which, in certain circumstances, is
capable of assuming all the three states. In
steam we recognise a perfectly elastic fluid,
in water, a perfect liquid, and in ice a com-
plete solid. These observations have tacitly
led to the conclusion which seems universally
adopted, that all bodies of sensible magnitude,
whether liquid or solid, are constituted of a
vast number of extremely small particles, or
atoms of matter bound together by a force of
attraction, which is more or less powerful
according to circumstances, and which as it
endeavours to prevent their separation, is very

--- Page 154 ---
142 ON THE CONSTITUTION OF BODIES.

properly called in that view, attraction of
cohesion ; but as it collects them from a dis-
persed state (as from steam into water) it is
called, attraction of aggregation, or more
simply, afinity. Whatever names it may go
by, they still signify one and the same power,
It is not my design to call in question this con-
clusion, which appears completely satisfactory ;
but to shew that we have hitherto made no
use of it, and that the consequence of the
neglect, has been a very obscure view of
chemical agency, which is daily growing more
so in proportion to the new lights attempted
to be thrown upon it.

The opinions I more particularly allude to,
are those of Berthollet on the Laws of che-
mical affinity ; such as that chemical agency is
proportional to the mass, and that in all che-
mical unions, there exist insensible gradations
in the proportions of the constituent principles.
The inconsistence of these opinions, both
with reason and observation, cannot, I think,
fail to strike every one who takes a proper
view of the phenomena.

Whether the ultimate particles of a body,
such as water, are all alike, that is, of the
same figure, weight, &c. is a question of some
importance. From what is known, we have
no reason to apprehend a diversity in these

--- Page 155 ---
ON THE CONSTITUTION OF BODIES. 143

particulars: if it does exist in water, it must
equally exist in the elements constituting water,
namely, hydrogen and oxygen. Now it is
scarcely possible to conceive how the aggre-
gates of dissimilar particles should be so uni-
formly the same. If some of the particles of
water were heavier than others, if a parcel
of the liquid on any occasion were constituted
principally of these heavier particles, it must
be supposed to affect the specific gravity of the
mass, a circumstance not known. Similar ob-
servations may be made on other substances.
Therefore we may conclude that ¢he ultimate
particles of all homogeneous bodies are per-
fectly alike in weight, figure, Sc. In other
words, every particle of water is like every
other particle of water; every particle of hy-
drogen is like every other particle of hydro-
gen, &c.

Besides the force of attraction, which, in
one character or another, belongs universally to
ponderable bodies, we find another force that
is likewise universal, or acts upon all matter
which comes under our cognisance, namely, a
force of repulsion. This is now generally,
and I think properly, ascribed to the agency of
heat. An atmosphere of this subtile fluid
constantly surrounds the atoms of all bodies,
and prevents them from being drawn into

144 ON THE CONSTITUTION OF BODIES.

actual contact. This appears to be satisfac.
torily proved by the observation, that the bulk
of a body may be diminished by abstracting
some of its heat: But from what has been
stated in the Jast section, it should seem that
enlargement and diminution of bulk depend
perhaps more on the arrangement, than on the
size of the ultimate particles. Be this as it
may, we cannot avoid inferring from the pre-
ceding doctrine on heat, and particularly from
the section on the natural zero of temperature,
that solid bodies, such as ice, contain a large
portion, perhaps 4 of the heat which the
same are found to contain in an elastic state,
as steam.

We are now to consider how these two
great antagonist powers of attraction and re-
pulsion are adjusted, so as to allow of the three
different states of clastic fluids, liquids, and
solids. We shall divide the subject into four
Sections; namely, first, on the constitution of
pure elastic fluids ; second, on the constitution
of mixed elastic fluids ; third, on the constitu-
tion of liquids, and fourth, on che constitution
of solids,

SECTION 1.

ON THE CONSTITUTION OF PURE
ELASTIC FLUIDS.

A pure elastic fluid is one, the constituent
particles of which are all alike, or in no way
distinguishable. Steam, or aqueous vapour,
hydrogenous gas, oxygenous gas, azotic gas,*
and several others are of this kind. These
fluids are constituted of particles possessing
very diffuse atmospheres of heat, the capacity
or bulk of the atmosphere being often one or
two thousand times that of the particle in a
liquid or solid form. Whatever therefore may
be the shape or figure of the solid atom ab-
stractedly, when surrounded by such an at-
mosphere it must be globular ; but as all the
globules in any small given volume are subject
to the same pressure, they must be equal in
bulk, and will therefore be arranged in hori-
zontal strata, like a pile of shot. A volume

* The novice will all along understand that several
chemical subjects are necessarily introduced before their
general history and character can be discussed.

--- Page 158 ---
146 ON PURE ELASTIC FLUIDS.

of elastic fluid is found to expand whenever the
pressure is taken off. ‘This proves that the re-
pulsion exceeds the attraction in such case.
The absolute attraction and repulsion of the
particles of an elastic fluid, we have no means
of estimating, though we can have little doubt
but that the cotemporary energy of both is great;
but the excess of the repulsive energy above
the attractive can be estimated, and the iaw of
increase and diminution be ascertained in many
cases. Thus in steam, the density may be
taken at y;',4 that of water; consequently
each particle of steam has 12 times the diameter
that one of water has, and must press upon
144 particles of a watery suriace; but the
pressure upon each is equivalent to that of a
column of water of 34 feet ; therefore the ex-
cess of the elastic force in a particle of steam is
equal to the weight of a column of particles of
water, whose height is 34 x 144= 4896 feet.
And further, this elastic force decreases as the
distance of the particles ‘increases. With re-
spect to steam and other elastic fluids then,
the force of cohesion is entirely counteracted
by that of repulsion, and the only force which
is efficacious to move the particles is the excess
of therepulsion above the attraction. Thus, if
the attraction be as 10 and the repulsion as
12, the effective repulsive force is as 2. It

--- Page 159 ---
ON PURE ELASTIC FLUIDS. 147

appears then, that an elastic fluid, so far from
Yrequiring any force to separate its particles, it
always requires a force to retain them in their
situation, or to prevent their separation.

A vessel full of any pure elastic fluid presents
to the imagination a picture like one full ofsmall
shot. The globules are all of the same size ;
but the particles of the fluid differ from those
of the shot, in that they are constituted of an
exceedingly small central atom of solid mat-
ter, which is surrounded by an atmosphere of
heat, of great density next the atom, but
gradually growing rarer according to some
power of the distance; whereas those of the
shot are globules, uniformly hard throughout,
and surrounded with atmospheres of heat of
no comparative magnitude.

It is known from experience, that the force
of amass of elastic fluid is directly as the
density. Whence is derived the law already
mentioned, that the repulsive power of each
particle is inversely as its diameter. That is,
the apparent repulsive power, if we may so
speak ; for the real or absolute force of re-
pulsion is not known, as Jong as we remain
ignorant of the attractive force. When we
expand any volume of elastic fluid, its particles
are enlarged, without any material change in
the quantity of their heat; it follows then, that

--- Page 160 ---
148 ON PURE ELASTIC FLUIDS.

the density of the atmospheres of heat must
fluctuate with the pressure. Thus, suppose a
measute of air were expanded into 8 measures ;
then, because the diameters of the elastic par-
ticles are as the cube root of the space, the
distances of the particles would be twice as
great as before, and the elastic atmospheres
would occupy nearly 8 times the space they
did before, with nearly the same quantity of
heat: whence we see that these atmospheres
must be diminished in density in nearly the
same ratio as the mass of elastic fluid.

Some elastic fluids, as hydrogen, oxygen, &c.
resist any pressure that has yet been applied
tothem. In such then it is evident the re-
pulsive force of heat is more than a match for
the affinity of the particles, and the external
pressure united. To what extent this would
continue we cannot say; but from analogy we
might apprehend that a still greater pressure
would succeed in giving the attractive force
the superiority, when the elastic fluid would
become a liquid or solid. In other elastic
fluids, as steam, upon the application of com-
pression to a certain degree, the elasticity ap-
parently ceases altogether, and the particles
collect in smal] drops of liquid, and fall down.
This phenomenon requires explanation.

From the very abrupt transition of steam

--- Page 161 ---
ON PURE ELASTIC FLUIDS. 149

from a volume of 1700 to that of 1, without
any material increase of pressure, one would
be inclined to think that the condensation of
it was owing to the breaking of a spring, rather
than to the curbing of one. The last however
I believe is the fact. The condensation arises
from the action of affinity becoming superior
to that of heat, by which the latter is over-
ruled, but not weakened. As the approxima-
tion of the particles takes place, their repulsion
increases from the condensation of the heat,
but their affinity increases, it should seem, in a
still greater ratio, till the approximation has at-
tained a certain degree, when an equilibrium
between those two powers takes place, and
the liquid, water, is the result. That this is the
true explanation we may learn from what has
been stated at page 131; wherein it is shewn
that the heat given off by the condensation of
steam, is in all probability no more than would
be given off by any permanently elastic fluid,
could it be mechanically condensed into the
like volume, and is moreover a small portion
of the whole heat previously in combination.
As far then as the heat is concerned in this
phenomenon, the circumstances would be the
same, whether the approximation of the par-
ticles was the effect of affinity, or of external
mechanical force,

--- Page 162 ---
150 ON MIXED ELASTIC FLUIDS,

The constitution of a liquid, as water, must
then be conceived to be that of an aggregate of
particles, exercising in a most powerful manner
the forces of attraction and repulsion, but
nearly in an equal degree.—Of this more in
the sequel.

SECTION 2.

ON THE CONSTITUTION OF MIXED
ELASTIC FLUIDS,

When two or more elastic fluids, whose
particles do not unite chemically upon mixture,
are brought together, one measure of each,
they occupy the space of two measures, but
become uniformly diffused through each other,
and remain so, whatever may be their specific
gravities. The fact admits of no doubt; but
explanations have been given in various ways,
and none of them completely satisfactory. As
the subject is one of primary importance in
forming a system of chemical principles, we
must enter somewhat more fully into the
discussion.

Dr. Priestley was one of the earliest to notice
the fact: it naturally struck him with surprise,

--- Page 163 ---
ON MIXED ELASTIC FLUIDS. 152

that two elastic fluids, having apparently no
affinity for each other, should not arrange
themselves according to their specific gravities,
as liquids do in like circumstances. Though
he found this was not the case after the elastic
fluids had once been thoroughly mixed, yet he
suggests it as probable, that if two of such
fluids could be exposed to each other without
agitation, the one specifically heavier would
retain its lower situation. He does not so
much as hint at such gases being retained in a
mixed state by affinity. With regard to his
suggestion of two gases being carefully ex-
posed to each other without agitation, I made
a series of experiments expressly to determine
the question, the results of which are given in
the Manch. Memoirs, Vol. 1. new series.
From these it seems to be decided that gases
always intermingle and gradually diffuse them-
selves amongst each other, if exposed ever so
carefully ; but it requires a considerable time
to produce a complete intermixture, when
the surface of communication is small. This
time may vary from a minute, to a day or more,
according to the quantity of the gases and the
freedom of communication.

‘When or by whom the notion of mixed gases
being held together by chemical affinity was
first propagated, I do not know ; but it seems

--- Page 164 ---
152 ON MIXED ELASTIC FLUIDS.

probable that the notion of water being dis-
solved in air, led to that of air being dissolved
in air—Philosophers found that water gra-
dually disappeared or evaporated in air, and
increased its elasticity; but steam at a low
temperature was known to be unable to over-
come the resistance of the air, therefore the
agency of affinity was necessary to account for
the effect. In the permanently elastic fluids
indeed, thisagency did not seem to be so much
wanted, as they are all able to support them-
selves; but the diffusion through each other
was a circumstance which did not admit of an
easy solution any other way. In regard to the
solution of water in air, it was natural to sup-
pose, nay, one might almost have been satisfied
without the aid of experiment, that the differ-
ent gases would have had different affinities for
water, and that the quantities of water dis-
solved in like circumstances, would have
varied according to the nature of the gas,
Saussure found however that there was no
difference in this respect in the solvent powers
of carbonic acid, hydrogen gas, and common
air.—It might be expected that at least the
density of the gas would have some influence
upon its solvent powers, that air of half density
would take half the water, or the quantity of
water would diminish in some proportion to

--- Page 165 ---
ON MIXED ELASTIC FLUIDS. 153

the density; but even here again we are
disappointed ; whatever be the rarefaction, if
water be present, the vapour produces the
same elasticity, and the hygrometer finally
settles at extreme moisture, as in air of com-
mon density in like circumstances. These
facts are sufficient to create extreme difficulty
in the conception how any principle of affinity
or cohesion between air and water can be the
agent. It is truly astonishing that the same
quantity of vapour should cohere to one particle
of air ina given space, as to one thousand in
the same space. But the wonder does not
cease here ; a torricellian vacuum dissolves wa-
ter; andin this instance we have vapour existing
independently of air at all temperatures ; what
makes it still more remarkable is, the vapour
in such vacuum is precisely the same in quan-
tity and force as in the like volume of any
kind of air of extreme moisture.

These and other considerations which oc-
curred to me some years ago, were sufficient to
make me altogether abandon the hypothesis of
air dissolving water, and to explain the phe-
nomena some other way, or to acknowledge
they were inexplicable. In the autumn of
1801, I hit upon an idea which seemed to be
exactly calculated to explain the phenomena
of vapour; it gave rise to a great variety of

--- Page 166 ---
154 ON MIXED ELASTIC FLUIDS,

experiments upon which a series of essays were
founded, which were read before the Literary
and Philosophical Society of Manchester, and
published in the 5th Vol. of their memoirs,
1802.

The distinguishing feature of the new
theory was, that the particles of one gas are
not elastic or repulsive in regard to the pat-
ticles of another gas, but only to the particles
of their own kind. Consequently when a
vessel contains a mixture of two such elastic
fluids, each acts independently upon the vessel,
with its proper elasticity, just as if the other
were absent, whilst no mutual action between
the fluids themselves is observed. This posi-
tion most effectually provided for the existence
of vapour of any temperature in the atmos-
phere, because it could have nothing but its
own weight to support; and it was perfectly
obvious why neither more nor less vapour could
exist in air of extreme moisture, than in a
vacuum of the same temperature. So far then
the great object of the theory was attained.
The Jaw of the condensation of vapour in the
atmosphere by cold, was evidently the same on
this scheme, as that of the condensation of
pure steam, and experience was found to con-
firm the conclusion at all temperatures. The
only thing now wanting to completely establish

--- Page 167 ---
ON MYXED ELASTIC FLUIDS. 155

the independent existence of aqueous vapour
in the atmosphere, was the conformity of other
liquids to water, in regard to the diffusion
and condensation of their vapour. This was
found to take place in several liquids, and
particularly in sulphuric ether, one which was
most likely to shew any anomaly to advantage
if it existed, on account of the great change of
expansibility in its vapour at ordinary tem-
peratures, The existence of vapour in the
atmosphere and its occasional condensation
were thus accounted for; but another
question remained, how does it rise from
a surface of water subject to the pressure
of the atmosphere? The consideration of
this made no part of the essays abovementioned,
it being apprehended, that if the other two
points could be obtained by any theory, this
third too, would, in the sequel, be accom-
plished.

From the novelty, both in the theory and the
experiments, and their importance, provided
they were correct, the essays were soon circu-
lated, both at home and abroad. The new
facts and experiments were highly valued,
some of the latter were repeated, and found
correct, and none of the results, as far as I
know, have been controverted ; but the theory
was almost universally misunderstood, and

--- Page 168 ---
156 ON MIXED ELASTIC FLUIDS.

consequently reprobated. This must have
have arisen partly at least from my being too
concise, and not sufficiently clear in its ex-
position.

Dr. Thomson was the first, as far as I know,
who publicly animadverted upon the theory ;
this gentleman, so well known for his excellent
System of Chemistry, observed in the first
edition of that work, that the theory would
not account for the equal distribution of gases ;
but that, granting the supposition of one gas
neither attracting nor repeiling another, the two
must still arrange themselves according to their
specific gravity. But the most general objec-
tion to it was quite of a different kind; it was
admitted, that the theory was adapted so as to
obtain the most uniform and permanent diffusion
of gases; but it was urged, that as one gas
was as a vacuum to another, a measure of any
gas being put to a measure of another, the
two measures ought to occupy the space of
one measure only. Finding that my views on
the subject were thus misapprehended, I
wrote an illustration of the theory, which was
published in the 3d Vol. of Nicholson’s Jour-
nal, for November, 1802. In that paper I
endeavoured to point out the conditions of
mixed gases more at large, according to my
hypothesis ; and particularly touched upon the

--- Page 169 ---
ON MIXED ELASTIC FLUIDS. 157

discriminating feature of it, that of two par-
ticles of any gas A, repelling each other by
the known stated Jaw, whilst one or more
particles of another gas B, were interposed in
a direct line, without at all affecting the re-
ciprocal action of the said two particles of A.
Or, if any particle of B were casually to come
in contact with one of A, and press against it,
this pressure did not preclude the cotemporary
action of all the surrounding particles of A
upon the one in contact with B, In this re-
spect the mutual action of particles of the same
gas was represented as resembling magnetic
action, which is not disturbed by the interven-
tion of a body not magnetic.

As the subject has since received the ani-
madversions of several authors, which it is
expedient to notice more or less, it will be
proper to point out the order intended to be
pursued. First, I shall consider the objections
to the new theory made by the several authors,
with their own views on the subject ; and
then shall give what modifications of the
theory, the experience and reflection of suc-
ceeding time have suggested to me. The
authors are Berthollet, Dr. Thomson, Mr.
Murray, Dr. Henry, and Mr. Gough.

Berthollet in his Chemical Statics (1804)
has given a chapter on the constitution of the

--- Page 170 ---
158 ON MIXED ELASTIC FLUIDS,

atmosphere, in which he has entered largely
into a discussion of the new theory. This cele-
brated chemist, upon comparing the results of
experiments made by De Luc, Saussure, Volta,
Lavoisier, Watt, &c. together with those of
Gay Lussac, and his own, gives his full assent
to the fact, that vapours of every kind increase
the elasticity of each species of gas alike, and
just as much as the force of the said vapours
in vacuo ; and not only so, but that the specific
gravity of vapour in air and vapour in vacuo
is in all cases the same (Vol. 1. Sect. 4.) Con-
sequently he adopts the theorem for finding
the quantity of vapour which a given volume
of aircan dissolve, which I have laid down;
namely,

é
“ef
where p represents the pressure upona given
volume (1) of dry air, expressed in inches of
mercury, f = the force of the vapour in vacuo
at the temperature, in inches of mercury, and
s =the space which the mixture of air and
vapour occupies under the given pressure, p,
after saturation. So far therefore we perfectly
agree: but he objects to the theory by which
I attempt to explain these phenomena, and
substitutes another of his own.

The first objection I shall notice is one that

s=

--- Page 171 ---
ON MIXED ELASTIC FLUIDS. 159

clearly shews Berthollet either does not under-
stand, or does not rightly apply the theory he
opposes; he says, “ If one gas occupied the
interstices of another, as though they were
vacancies, there would not be any augmenta-
tion of volume when aqueous or ethereal va-
pour was combined with the air; nevertheless
there is one proportional to the quantity of
vapour added: humidity should increase the
specific gravity of the air, whereas it renders
it specifically lighter, as has been already
noticed by Newton.” This is the objection
which has been so frequently urged ; it has
even been stated by Mr. Gough, if I under-
stand him aright, in almost the same words
(Nicholson’s Journal, Vol. 9, page 162) ; yet
this last gentleman is profoundly skilled in
the mechanical action of fluids. Let a tall
cylindrical glass vessel containing dry air be
inverted over mercury, anda portion of the
air drawn out by asyphon, till an equilibrium
of pressure is established within and without ;
let a small portion of water, ether, &c. be
then thrown up into the vessel; the vapour
rises and occupies the interstices of the air as
avoid; but what is the obvious consequence?
Why, the surface of the mercury being now
pressed both by the dry air, and by the new
raised vapour, is more pressed within than

--- Page 172 ---
160 ON MIXED ELASTIC FLUIDS,

without, and an enlargement of the volume of
air is unavoidable, in order to restore the
equilibrium. Again, in the open air: suppose
there were no aqueous atmosphere around the
earth, only an azotic one = 23 inches of mers
cury, and an oxygenous one = 6 inches. The
air being thus perfectly dry, evaporation would
commence with great speed. The vapour
first formed being constantly urged to ascend
by that below, and as constantly resisted by the
air, must, in the first instance, dilate the other
two atmospheres; (for, the ascending steam
adds its force to the upward elasticity of the
two gases, and in part alleviates their pressure,
the necessary consequence of which is dilata-
tion.) At last when all the vapour has as-
cended, that the temperature will admit of,
the aqucous atmosphere attains an equilibrium ;
it no longer presses upon the other two, but
upon the earth; the others return to their
original density and pressure throughout. In
this case it is true, there would not be any
augmentation of volume when aqueous vapour
was combined with the air; humidity would
increase the weight of the congregated atmo-
spheres, but diminish their specific gravity under
a given pressure. One would have thought that
this solution of the phenomenon upon my
hypothesis was too obvious to escape the notice

--- Page 173 ---
ON MIXED ELASTIC FLUIDS. 161

of any one in any degree conversant with
pneumatic chemistry. Berthollet indeed en-
quires, ‘“ Issuch a divsion of the same pressure
of the atmosphere analogous with any physical
property yet known? Can it be conceived that
an elastic substance exists, which adds its
volume to that of another, and which never-
theless does not act on it by its expansive
force ?” Certainly ; we can not only conceive
it, but bring an instance that must be allowed
to be in point. Two magnets repel each
other, that is, act upon each other with an ex-
pansive force, yet they do not act upon other
bodies in the same way, but merely as inelastic
bodies ; and this no doubt would be the same
if they were reduced to atoms: So two par-
ticles of the same kind of air may act upon
each other elastically, and upon other bodies
inelastically, and therefore not at all, unless
when in contact.

Berthollet observes, “ Hydrogen gas and
oxygen gas form water ina given circumstance;
azotic gas, and oxygen gas, can also produce
nitric acid; but the reciprocal action which
decides the combinations cannot be considered
asa force commencing at the precise moment
at which it is manifested, it must have existed
long before producing its effect, and increases
gradually till it becomes preponderant.” It is

--- Page 174 ---
162 ON MIXED ELASTIC FLUIDS.

no doubt true that the opposite powers of at-
traction and repulsion are frequently, perhaps
constantly, energetic at the same instant; but
the effect produced in those cases arises from
the difference of the two powers. When the
excess of the repulsive power above the at-
tractive in different gases is comparatively
small and insignificant, it constitutes that cha-
racter which may be denominated neutral, and
which I supposed to exist in the class of mixed
gases which are not observed to manifest any
sign of chemical union. I would not be un-
derstood to deny an energetic affinity between
oxygen and hydrogen, &c. in a mixed state ;
but that affinity is more than counterbalanced
by the repulsion of the heat, except in cir-
cumstances which it is not necessary at present
to consider.

Again, “ Azotic gas comports itself with
oxygen gas, in the changes occasioned by tem-
perature and pressure, precisely like one and
the same gas: Is it necessary to have recourse
to a supposition which obliges us to admit so
great a difference of action without an osten-
sible cause?” It is possible this may appear
an objection to a person who does not under-
stand the theory, but it never can be any to
one who does. If a mixture of gas, such as
atmospheric air, containing azote pressing

--- Page 175 ---
ON MIXED ELASTIC FLUIDS. 163

with a force equal to 24 inches of mercury,
and oxygen with a force equal to 6 inches,
were suddenly condensed into half the com-
pass, the azotic gas would then evidently, on
my hypothesis, press with a force — 48
inches, and the oxygen with a force = 12
inches, making together 60 inches, just
the same as any simple gas. And a similar
change in the elasticity of each would take
place by heat and cold. Will the opposite
theory of Berthollet be equally free from this
objection? We shall presently examine it.

Another objection is derived from the very
considerable time requisite for a body of hy-
drogen to descend into one of carbonic acid ;
if one gas were as a vacuum for another, why
is the equilibrium not instantly established ?
This objection is certainly plausible ; we shall
consider it more at large hereafter.

In speaking of the pressure of the atmo-
sphere retaining water in a liquid state, which I
deny, Berthollet adopts the idea of Lavoisier,
‘that without it the molecule would be in-
finitely dispersed, and that nothing would
limit their separation, unless their own weight
should collect them to form an atmosphere.”
This, I may remark, is not the language dic-
tated by a correct notion on the subject. Sup-
pose our atmosphere were annihilated, and the

--- Page 176 ---
164 ON MIXED ELASTIC FLUIDS,

waters on the surface of the globe were in
stantly expanded into steam ; surely the action
of gravity would collect the molecule into an
atmosphere of similar constitution to the one
we now possess; but suppose the whole mass
of water evaporated amounted in weight to
30 inches of mercury, how could it support its
own weight at the common temperature? It
would in a short time be condensed into water
merely by its weight, leaving a small portion,
such as the temperature could support, amount-
ing perhaps to half an inch of mercury in
weight, as a permanent atmosphere, which
would effectually prevent any more vapour
from rising, unless there were an increase of
temperature. Does not every one know that
water and other liquids can exist in a Torricel-
lian vacuum at low temperatures solely by the
pressure of vapour arising from them? What
need then of the pressure of the atmosphere in
order to prevent an excess of vapourisation?
After having concluded that “ without the
pressure of the zrial atmosphere, liquids would
pass to the elastic state,” Berthollet proceeds
in the very next paragraph to shew that the
quantity of vapour in the atmosphere may in
fact be much more than would exist if the
atmosphere were suppressed, and hence infers,
“that the variations of the barometer oc-

--- Page 177 ---
ON MIXED ELASTIC FLUIDS, 165

casioned by those of the humidity of the at-
mosphere may be much greater than was be-
lieved by Saussure and Deluc.” I cannot see
how the author reconciles the opposite con-
clusions.

The experiments of Fontana on the distil-
lation of water and ether in close vessels con-
taining air, are adduced to prove, that vapours
do not penetrate air without resistance. This
is true no doubt ; vapour cannot make its way
in such circumstances through a long and
circuitous route without time, and if the ex-
ternal atmosphere keep the vessel cool, the
vapour may be condensed by its sides, and
fall down in a liquid form as fast as it is ge-
nerated, without ever penetrating in any sen-
sible quantity to its remote extremity.

We come now to the consideration of that
theory which Berthollet adopts in his explana
tion of the phenomenaof gaseous mixtures. Ac-
cording to his theory, there are two degrees of
affinity. The one is strong, makes the particles of
bodies approach nearer to each other,and gene-
rally expels heat : the effect of this may be cal-
led combination ; for instance, when oxygen gas
is put to nitrous gas, the two combine, give
out heat, are condensed in volume, and become
possessed of properties diflerent from what
they had previously. The other is weak ; it

--- Page 178 ---
166 ON MIXED ELASTIC FLUIDS.

does not sensibly condense the volume of any
mixture, nor give out heat, nor change the
properties of the ingredients: its effect may
be called solution or dissolution ; for instance,
when oxygen gas and azotic gas are mixed in
due proportion, they constitute atmospheric air,
in which they retain their distinguishing pro-
perties.

It is upon this supposed solution of one
elastic fluid in another that I intend to make a
few observations. That I have not misre-
presented the author's ideas, will, I think, ap-
pear from the following quotations, “ When
different gases are mixed, whose action is con-
fined to this solution, no change is observed in
the temperature, or in the volume resulting from
the mixture ; hence itmay be concluded, that
this mutual action of two gases does not pro-
duce any condensation, and that it cannot sur-
mount the effort of the elasticity, or the af-
finity for caloric, so that the properties of each
gas are not sensibly changed—.” “ Although
both the solution and combination of two
gases are the effect of a chemical action, which
only differs in its intensity, a real difference
may be established between them, because
there is a very material difference between the
results: the combination of two gases always
leads to a condensation of their volume, and

--- Page 179 ---
ON MIXED ELASTIC FLUIDS. 167

gives rise to new properties ; on their solution,
the gases share in common the changes arising
from compression and temperature, and pre-
serve their individual properties, which are
only diminished in the ratio of the slight
action which holds them united.” (Page 198.)
“The mutual affinity of the gases can, therefore,
produce between them an effect which is
greater than their difference of specific gravity,
but which is inferior to the elastic tension
which belongs to each molecule of both, so
that the volume is not changed by this action ;
the liquids which take the elastic state, com-
port themselves afterwards like the gases.”
(Page 218.) “Solution must be distinguished
from combination, not only because in the
first, each of the substances is retained by an
affinity so weak, that it preserves its dimen-
sions.—” (Page 219.) Again, “ It cannot be
doubted, that the parts of elastic fluids are not
endued with the force of cohesion, as the sub-
stances dissolved by them undergo an equal
distribution, which could not happen but by
the means of a reciprocal chemical attraction ;
that which constitutes the force of cohesion.”
(Researches into the Laws of chemical affinity,
Eng. Trans. page 57.) Here the translator
has, I apprehend, mistaken the English idiom.
The author means to say, that the parts of

--- Page 180 ---
168 ON MIXED ELASTIC FLUIDS.

elastic fluids are endued with the force of
cohesion ; but this he applies only to hetero-
geneous particles. He certainly does not
mean that the particles of homogeneous elastic
fluids possess the force of cohesion.

Newton has demonstrated from the phe-
nomena of condensation and rarefaction that
elastic fluids are constituted of particles, which
repel one another by forces which increase in
proportion as the distance of their centres
diminishes: in other words, the forces are
reciprocally as the distances. This deduction
will stand as long as the Laws of elastic fluids
continue to be what they are. What a pity it
is that all who attempt to reason, or to theorise
respecting the constitution of elastic fluids,
should not make themselves thoroughly ac-
quainted with this immutable Law, and con-
stantly hold it in their view whenever they
start any new project! When we contemplate
a mixture of oxygenous and hydrogenous gas,
what does Berthollet conceive, are the particles
that repel each other according to the New-
tonian Law? The mixture must consist of
such ; and he ought in the very first instance
to have informed us what constitutes the
unity of a particle in his solution. If he
grants that each particle of oxygen retains its
unity, and each particle of hydrogen does the

--- Page 181 ---
ON MIXED ELASTIC FLUIDS. 169

same, then we must conclude that the mutual
action of two particles of oxygen is the same
as that of a particle of oxygen, and one of
hydrogen, namely, a repulsion according to
the Law above stated, which effectually de-
stroys the supposed solution by chemical
agency. But if it be supposed that each par-
ticle of hydrogen attaches itself to a particle of
oxygen, and the two particles so united form
one, from which the repulsive energy emanates;
then the new elastic fluid may perfectly con-
form to the Newtonian Law; in this case a
true saturation will take place when the num-
ber of particles of hydrogen and oxygen in a
mixture happen to be equal, or at least in the
ratio of some simple numbers, such as 1 to 2,
1 to 3, &c. Now something like this does
actually take place when a real combination
is formed, as for instance, steam, and nitric
acid formed of a mixture of oxygen and
nitrous gas. Here we have new elastic fluids,
the atoms of which repel one another by the
common Law, heat is given out, a great con-
densation of volume ensues, and the new
fluids differ from their constituents in their
chemical relations. It remains then to deter-
mine whether, in the instance of solution, all
these effects take place in a “ slight’ degree ;
that is, in so small a degree as not to be

--- Page 182 ---
170 ON MIXED ELASTIC FLUIDS.

cognisable to any of the senses. It certainly
requires an extraordinary stretch of the. imagi-
nation to admit the affirmative.

One great reason for the adoption of this,
or any other theory on the subject, arises from
the phenomena of the evaporation of water.
How is water taken up and retained in the
atmosphere? It cannot be in the state of
vapour, it is said, because the pressure is too
great: there must therefore be a true chemical
solution, But when we consider that the sur-
face of water is subject to a pressure equal to
30 inches of mercury, and besides this pressure,
there is a sensible affinity between the particles
of water themselves ; how does the insensible
affinity of the atmosphere for water overcome
both these powers ? It is tome quite inexpli-
cable upon this hypothesis, theleading object of
which is to account for this very phenomenon.
Further, if a particle of air has attached a
particle of water to it, what reason can be
assigned why a superior particle of air should
rob an inferior one of its property, when
each particle possesses the same power? Ifa
portion of common salt be dissolved in water
and a little muriatic acid added ; is there any
reason to suppose the additional acid displaces
that already combined with the soda, and that
upon evaporation the salt is not obtained with

--- Page 183 ---
ON MIXED ELASTIC FLUIDS. 171

the identical acid it previously had? Or, if
oxygen gas be confined by water, is there any
reason to suppose that the hydrogen of the
water is constantly giving its oxygen to the air
and receiving an equal quantity from the
same? Perhaps it will be said in the case of
air dissolving water, that it is not the affection
of one particle for one, it is that of a mass of
particles for another mass; it is the united
action of all the atoms in the atmosphere
upon the water, which raises up a particle.
But as all these energies are reciprocal, the
water must have a like action on the air, and
then an atmosphere over water would press
downward by a force greater than its weight,
which is contradicted by experience.

When two measures of hydrogen and one
of oxygen gas are mixed, and fired by the
electric spark, the whole is converted into
steam, and if the pressure be great, this
steam becomes water. It is most probable
then that there is the same number of particles
in two measures of hydrogen as in one of
oxygen. Suppose then three measures of
hydrogen are mixed with one of oxygen, and
this slight affinity operates as usual ; how is the
union effected? According to the principle
of equal division, each atom of oxygen ought
to have one atom and a half of hydrogen at.

--- Page 184 ---
172 OX MIXED ELASTIC FLUIDS.

tached to it ; but this is impossible ; one half
of the atoms of oxygen must then take two of
hydrogen, and the other half, one each. But
the former would be specifically lighter than
the latter, and ought to be found at the top of
the solution; nothing like this is however
observed on any occasion.

Much more might be advanced to shew the
absurdity of this doctrine of the solution of one
gas in another, and the insufficiency of it to
explain any of the phenomena; indeed I
should not have dwelt so long upon it, had
I not apprehended that respectable authority
was likely to give it credit, more than any ar-
guments in its behalf derived from physical
principles.

Dr. Thomson, in the 3d Edition of his
System of Chemistry, has entered into a dis-
cussion on the subject of mixed gases ; he
seems to comprehend the excellence and de-
fects of my notions on these subjects, with
great acuteness. He does not conclude with
Berthollet, that on my hypothesis, “ there
would not be any augmentation of volume
when aqueous and ethereal vapour was com-
bined with the air,” which has been so com-
mon an objection, There is however one
objection which this gentleman urges, that
shews he does not completely understand the

--- Page 185 ---
ON MIXED ELASTIC FLUIDS. 173

mechanism of my hypothesis. At page 448,
Vol. 3. he observes that from the principles of
hydrostatics, “ each particle of a fluid sustains
the whole pressure. Nor can I perceive any
reason why this principle should not hold,
even on the supposition that Dalton’s hypo-
thesis is well founded.” Upon this I would
observe, that when once an equilibrium is
established in any mixture of gases, each par-
ticle of gas is pressed as if by the surrounding
particles of its own kind only. It is in the re-
nunciation of that hydrostatical principle that
the leading feature of the theory consists. The
lowest particle of oxygen in the atmosphere
sustains the weight of all the particles of
oxygen above it, and the weight of no other.
It was therefore a maxim with me, that every
particle of gas is equally pressed in every di-
rection, but the pressure arises from the particles
of its own kind only. Indeed when a mea-
sure of oxygen is put to a measure of azote, at
the moment the two surfaces come in contact,
the particles of each gas press against those of
the other with their full force; but the two
gases get gradually intermingled, and the force
which each particle has to sustain proportionally
diminishes, till at last it becomes the same as
that of the original gas dilated to twice its
yolume. The ratio of the forces is as the cube

--- Page 186 ---
174 ON MIXED ELASTIC FLUIDS.

root of the spaces inversely; that is, as
3V2:1, or as 1.26: 1 nearly. In such a
mixture as has just been mentioned, then,
the common hypothesis supposes the pressure
of each particle of gas to be 1.26; whereas
mine supposes it only to be 1; but the sum
of the pressure of both gases on the containing
vessel, or any other surface, is exactly the same
on both hypotheses.

Excepting the above objection, all the rest
which Dr. Thomson has made, are of a nature
not so easily to be obviated ;—he takes notice
of the considerable time which elapses before
two gases are completely diffused through each
other, as Berthollet has done, and conceives
this fact, makes against the supposition, that
one gas is asa vacuum to another. He further
objects, that if the particles of different gases
are inelastic to each other; then a particle of
oxygen coming into actual contact with one of
hydrogen, ought to unite with it, and forma
particle of water; but, an the other hand, he
properly observes, that the great facility with
which such combinations are effected in such
instances as a mixture of nitrous and oxygen
gas, is an argument in favour of the hypo-
thesis.—Dr. Thomson founds another objection
upon the facility of certain combinations, when
one of the ingredients is in a nascent form;

--- Page 187 ---
ON MIXED ELASTIC FLUIDS, 115

that is, just upon the point of assuming the
elastic state; this, he observes, “ seems in-
compatible with the hypothesis, that gases are
not mutually elastic.” Upon the whole, Dr.
Thomson inclines to the opinion of Berthollet,
that gases have the property of dissolving each
other; and admits, “ however problematical
it may appear at first view, that the gases not
only mutually repel each other, but likewise
mutually attract.” Ihave no doubt if he had
taken due time to consider this conclusion, he
would, with me, have pronounced it absurd :
but of this again in the sequel.

With regard to the objection, that one gas
makesa more durable resistance to the entrance
of another, than it ought to do on my hy-
pothesis: This occurred to me in a very early
period of my speculations ; I devised the train
of reasoning which appeared to obviate the
objection; but it being necessarily of a ma-
thematical nature, I did not wish to obtrude it
upon the notice of chemical philosophers, but
rather to wait till it was called for—The
resistance which any medium makes to the
motion of a body, depends upon the surface of
that body, and is greater as the surface is
greater, all other circumstances being the
same. A ball of lead 1 inch in diameter meets
with a certain resistance in falling through the

--- Page 188 ---
176 ON MIXED ELASTIC FLUIDS.

air; but the same ball, being made into a
thousand smaller ones of 2. of an inch di-
ameter, and falling with the same velocity,
meets with 10 times the resistance it did
before : because the force of gravity increases
as the cube of the diameter of any particle,
and the resistance only as the sguare of the
diameter. Hence it appears, that in order to
increase the resistance of particles moving in
any medium, it is only necessary to divide
them, and that the resistance will be a maxi-
mum when the division isa maximum. We
have only then to consider particles of lead
falling through air by their own gravity, and
we may have an idea of the resistance of one
gas entering another, only the particles of lead
must be conceived to be infinitely small, if I
may be allowed the expression. Here we
shall find great resistance, and yet no one, I
should suppose, will say, that the air and the
lead are mutually elastic.

The other two objections of Dr. Thomson,
J shall wave the consideration of at present.

Mr. Murray has lately edited a system of
chemistry, in which he has given a very clear
description of the phenomena of the atmo-
sphere, and of other similar mixtures of elastic
fluids. He has ably discussed the different
theories that have been proposed on the subject,

--- Page 189 ---
ON MIXED ELASTIC FLUIDS. 177

and given a perspicuous view of mine, which
he thinks is ingenious, and calculated to ex-
plain several of the phesomera well, but upon
the whole, not equally satisfactory with that
which he adopts. He does not object to the
mechanism of my hypothesis in regard to the
independent elasticity of the several gases en-
tering into any mixture, but argues that the
phenomena do not require so extraordinary a
postulatum ; and more particularly disapproves
of the application of my theory to account for
evaporation.

The principal feature in Mr. Murray’s
theory, and which he thinks distinguishes it
from mine, is “that between mixed gases,
which are capable, under any circumstances
of combining, an attraction must always be
exerted.” It is unnecessary to recount the
arguments on behalf of this conclusion, because
it will not be controverted. Mr. Murray an-
nounces his views of the constitution of the
atmosphere, as follows: ‘“ Perhaps that che-
mical attraction which subsists between the
solid bases of these gases, but which, when they
are merely mixed together, cannot, from the dis-
tance at which their particles are placed by
the repulsive power of caloric, bring them into
intimate union, may still be so far exerted, as
to prevent their separation: or, they may be


--- Page 190 ---
178 ON MIXED ELASTIC FLUIDS.

retained in mixture by that force of adhesion,
which, exerted at the surfaces of many bodies,
retains them in contact with considerable
force.” He supports these notions at length
by various observations, and repeats some of
the observations of Berthollet, whose doctrine
on this subject, as has been seen, is nearly the
same.

Before we animadvert on these principles,
it may be convenient to extend the first a little
farther, and to adopt as a maxim, “ that be~
tween the particles of pure gases, which are
capable under any circumstances of combining,
an attraction must always be exerted.” This,
Mr. Murray cannot certainly object to, in the
case of steam, a pure elastic fluid, the par-
ticles of which are known in certain circum-
stances tocombine. Nor will it be said that
steam and a permanent gas are different ; for
he justly observes, “ this distinction (between
gases and vapours) is merely relative, and
arises from the difference of temperature at
which they are formed ; the state with regard
to each, while they exist in it, is precisely the
same.” Js steam then constituted of particles
in which the attraction is so far exerted as to
prevent their separation? No: they exhibit
no traces of attraction, more than the like
number of particles of oxygen do, when in


--- Page 191 ---
ON MIXED ELASTIC FLUIDS. 179

the gaseous form. What then is the con-
clusion? It is this: notwithstanding it must be
allowed, that all bodies, at all times, and in
every situation, atiract one another ; yet in cer-
tain circumstances, they are likewise actuated
by a repulsive power ; the only efficient motive
force is then the difference of these two
powers.

From the circumstance of gases mixing to-
gether without experiencing any sensible
diminution of volume, the advocates for the
agency of chemical affinity, characterise it as
a “slight action,” and ‘a weak reciprocal
action:” So far I think they are consistent ;
but when we hear of this affinity being so far
exerted as to prevent the separation of elastic
particles, I do not conceive with what pro-
priety t can be called weak. Suppose this
affinity should be exercised in the case of
steam of 212°; then the attraction becoming
equal to the repulsion, the force which any
one particle would exercise must be equal to
the weight of a column of water of 4896 fect
high. (See page 146.)

Tt is somewhat remarkable that those gases
which are known to combine occasionally, as
azote and oxygen, and those which are never
known to combine, as hydrogen and carbonic
acid, should dissolve one another with equal

--- Page 192 ---
180 ON MIXED ELASTIC FLUIDS.

facility ; nay, these last exercise this solvent
power with more effect than the former; for,
hydrogen can draw up carbonic acid from the
bottom to the top of any vessel, notwithstand-
ing the latter is 20 times the specific gravity of
the former. One would have thought that a
force of adhesion was more to be expected in
the particles of steam, than in a mixture of
hydrogen and carbonic acid. But it is the
business of those who adopt the theory of the
mutual solution of gases to explain these
difficulties.

In a mixture where are 8 particles of oxygen
for 1 of hydrogen, it is demonstrable that the
central distances of the particles of hydrogen
are at a medium twice as great as those of
oxygen. Now supposing the central distance
of two adjacent particles of hydrogen to be
denoted by 12, query, what is supposed to
be the central distance of any one particle of
hydrogen from that one particle, or those
particles of oxygen with which it is connected
by this weak chemical union? It would be
well if those who understand and maintain
the doctrine of chemical solution would re-
present how they conceive this to be ; it would
enable those who are desirous to learn, to obtain
a clear idea of the system, and those who are
dissatisfied with it, to point out its defects with

--- Page 193 ---
ON MIXED ELASTIC FLUIDS, 181

more precision. The greatest possible central
distance would be 8! in the above instance,
and the least might perhaps be 1. Berthollet,
who decries the diagram by which I endea-
voured to illustrate my ideas on this subject,
has not given us any precise information,
either verbally or otherwise, relative to the
collocation of the heterogeneous particles, un-
less it is to be gathered from the consideration
that the affinity is so weak that the mixture of
fluids preserves its dimensions. What can this
weak affinity do, when opposed by a repulsive
power of infinite superiority ?

In discussing the doctrines of elastic fluids
mixed with vapour, Mr. Murray seems dis-
posed to question the accuracy of the fact, that
the quantity of vapour is the same in vacuo as
in air, though he has not attempted to ascertain
in which case it more abounds. This is cer-
tainly the touchstone of the mechanical and
chemical theories; and I had thought that
whoever admitted the truth of the fact, must
unavoidably adopt the mechanical theory.
Berthollet however, convinced from his own
experience, that the fact was incontrovertible,
attempts to reconcile it, inimical as it is, to
the chemical theory ; with what success it is
left to others to judge. Mr. Murray joins
with Berthollet in condemning as extravagant

--- Page 194 ---
182 ON MIXED ELASTIC FLUIDS,

the position which I maintain, that if the at-
mosphere were annihilated, we should have
little more aqueous vapour than at present
exists in it. Upon which I shall only remark,
that if either of those gentlemen will calculate,
or give a rough estimate upon their hypothesis,
of the quantity of aqueous vapour that would be
collected around the earth, on the said supposi-
tion, I will engage to discuss the subject with
them more at large.

In 1802, Dr. Henry announced a very
curious and important discovery, which was
afterwards published in the Philosophical Trans-
actions ; namely, that the quantity of any gas
absorbed by water is increased in direct pro-
portion to the pressure of the gas on the sur-
face of the water. Previously to this, 1 was
engaged in an investigation of the quantity of
carbonic acid in the atmosphere ; it was mat-
ter of surprise to me that lime water should so
readily manifest the presence of carbonic acid
in the air, whilst pure water by exposure for
any length of time, gave not the least traces
of that acid. I thought that length of time
ought to compensate for weakness of affinity-
In pursuing the subject I found that the
quantity of this acid taken up by water was
greater or less in proportion to its greater or
less density in the gaseous mixture, incumbent

--- Page 195 ---
ON MIXED ELASTIC FLUIDS. 183

upon the surface, and therefore ceased to be
surprised at water absorbing so insensible a
portion from the atmosphere. I had not how-
ever entertained any suspicion that this law
was generally applicable to the gases till Dr.
Henry’s discovery was announced. Immedi-
ately upon this, it struck me as essentially ne-
cessary in ascertaining the quantity of any gas
which a given volume of water will absorb,
that we must be careful the gas is perfectly
pure or unmixed with any other gas whatever ;
otherwise the maximum effect for any given
pressure cannot be produced. This thought
was suggested to Dr. Henry, and found to
be correct ; in consequence of which, it be-
came expedient to repeat some of his ex-
periments relating to the quantity of gas
absorbed under a given pressure, Upon due
consideration of all these phenomena, Dr.
Henry became convinced, that there was no
system of elastic fluids which gave so simple,
easy and intelligible a solution of them, as the
one I adopt, namely, that each gas in any
mixture exercises a distinct pressure, which
continues the same if the other gases are with-
drawn. In the 8th Vol. of Nicholson’s Jour-
nal, may be seen a letter addressed to me, in
which Dr. Henry has clearly pointed out his
reasons for giving my theory a preference.

--- Page 196 ---
184 ON MIXED ELASTIC FLUIDS.

In the 9th Vol. isa letter from Mr. Gough,
containing some animadyversions, which were
followed by an appropriate reply from Dr.
Henry.

Tn the 8th, 9th, and 10th Volumes of Ni-
cholson’s Journal, and in the first Vol. of the
Manchester Memoirs (new series) may be
seen some animadversions of Mr. Gough, on
my doctrine of mixed gases, with some of
his own opinions on the same subject. Mr.
Gough conceives the atmosphere to be a
chemical compound of gases, vapour, &e. and
he rests his belief chiefly upon the observance
of certain hygrometrical phenomena, such as
that air absorbs moisture from bodies in certain
cases, and in others restores it to them, shew-
ing that air has an affinity for water, which may
be overcome by another more powerful one.
This opinion, as Mr. Murray observes, is the
one we have from Dr. Halley ; it was supported
by Le Roy, Hamilton and Franklin, and
might be considered as the prevailing opinion,
till Saussure, in his celebrated Essays on hy-
grometry, published in 1783, suggested that
water was first changed into vapour, and was in
that state dissolved by the air. This amphibious
theory of Saussure does not seem to have gained
any converts to it, though it pointed out the
instability of the other. Finally, the theory

--- Page 197 ---
ON MIXED ELASTIC FLUIDS. 185

of the chemical solution of water in air, re-
ceived its death blow in 1791, by the publica-
tion of Pictet’s Essay on Fire, and more par-
ticularly by De Luc’s paper on evaporation,
published in the Philosophical Transactions
for 1792. These gentlemen demonstrated,
that all the train of hygrometrical phenomena
takes place just as well, indeed rather quicker,
in a yacuum, than in air, provided the same
quantity of moisture is present. All the
influence that any kind or density of air has,
is to retard the effect; but in the end it be-
comes the same.

The only objection which Mr. Gough has
presented that appears to me to raise any dif-
ficulty, is that in regard to the propagation of
sound: If the atmosphere consist chiefly of
two distinct elastic media, it is urged that
distant sounds ought to be heard double; that
is, the same sound would be heard twice, ac-
cording as it was brought by one or other of
the atmospheres. By calculation I find that
if sound move at the rate of 1000 feet per
second in an atmosphere of azotic gas, it
ought to move in the other gases as follows:
namely,

--- Page 198 ---
186 ON MIXED ELASTIC FLUIDS

Feet.
Sound moves in azotic gas 3000 per second.
oxygen gas 930
—— carb. acid 804
aqueous vap. 1175

According to this table, if a strong and
loud sound were produced 13 miles off, the
first would be a weak impression of it brought
by the atmosphere of aqueous vapour, in 59
seconds ; the second would be the strongest
of all, brought by the atmosphere of azotic
gass, in 68} seconds; the third would be
much inferior to the second, brought by the
oxygenous atmosphere, in 74 seconds ; the
fourth and last brought by the carbonic acid
atmosphere would be extremely weak, in 85
seconds.—Now though observation does not
perfectly accord with the theory in this re-
spect, it comes as near it, perhaps, as it does
to that of the more simple constitution of the
atmosphere which Mr, Gough maintains.
Derham, who has perhaps made the greatest
number of accurate observations on distant
sounds, remarked that the report of acannon
fired at the distance of 13 miles from him, did
not strike his ear with a single sound, but that
it was repeated 5 or 6 times close to each other.
“ The two first cracks were louder than the

--- Page 199 ---
ON MIXED ELASTIC FLUIDS. 187

third; but the last cracks were Jounder than
any of the rest.” Cavallo, in his experimental
philosophy, after quoting the above observa-
tions, proceeds, “ this repetition of the sound
probably originated from the reflection of a
single sound, from hills, houses, or otlier objects,
not much distant from the cannon. But it
appears from general observation, and where
no echo can be suspected, that the sound of a
cannon, at the distance of 10 or 20 miles, is
different from the sound when near. In the
latter case, the crack is loud and instantaneous,
of which we cannot appreciate the height.
‘Whereas in the former case, viz. at a distance,
it isa grave sound, which may be compared to
a determinate musical sound ; and instead of
being instantaneous, it begins softly, swells
to its greatest loudness, and then dies away
growling.—Nearly the same thing may be
observed with respect to a clap of thunder,
other sounds are likewise altered in quality by
the distance.” (Vol. 2. page 331.)

I shall now proceed to give my present
views on the subject of mixed gases, which
are somewhat different from what they were
when the theory was announced, in conse-
quence of the fresh lights which succeeding
experience has diffused. In prosecuting my
enquiries into the nature of elastic fluids, I

--- Page 200 ---
188 ON MIXED ELASTIC FLUIDS.

soon perceived it was necessary, if possible, to
ascertain whether the atoms or ultimate par-
ticles of the different gases are of the same
size or volume in like circumstances of tem-
perature and pressure. By the size or volume
of an ultimate particle, I mean in this place,
the space it occupies in the state of a pure
elastic fluid ; in this sense the bulk of the par-
ticle signifies the bulk of the supposed im-
penetrable nucleus, together with that of its
surrounding repulsive atmosphere of heat.
At the time I formed the theory of mixed
gases, I had a confused idea, as many have,
I suppose, at this time, that the particles of
elastic fluids are all of the same size; that a
given volume of oxygenous gas contains
just as many particles as the same volume
of hydrogenous; or if not, that we had
no data from which the question could
be solved. But from a train of reason-
ing, similar to that exhibited at page 71, I
became convinced that different gases have
not their particles of the same size: and that
the following may be adopted as a maxim,
till some reason appears to the contrary:
namely,—

That every species of pure elastic fluid has
its particles globular and all of a size ; but
that no two species agree in the size of their

--- Page 201 ---
ON MIXED ELASTIC FLUIDS. 189

particles, the pressure and temperature being
the same.

There was another thing concerning which
I was dubiou, ; whether heat was the cause of
repulsion. I was rather inclined to ascribe re-
pulion to a force resembling magnetism,
which acts on one kind of matter, and has no
effect onanother. For, if heat were the cause
of repulsion, there seemed no reason why a
particle of oxygen should not repel one of
hydrogen with the same force as one of its
own kind, especially if they were both of a
size. Upon more mature consideration, I sec
no sufficient reason for discarding the common
opinion, which ascribes repulsion to heat;
and I think the phenomena of mixed gases
may still be accounted for, by repulsion,
without the postulatum, that their particles
are mutually inelastic, and free from such of
the preceding objections as I have left un-
answered,

When we contemplate upon the disposition
of the globular particles in a volume of pure
elastic fluid, we perceive it must be analogous
to that of a square pile of shot; the particles
must be disposed into horizontal strata, each
four particles forming a square: in a superior
stratum, each particle rests upon four particles
below, the points of its contact with all four

--- Page 202 ---
190 ON MIXED ELASTIC FLUIDS,

being 45° above the horizontal plane, or that
plane which passes through the centres of
the four particles. On this account the pres-
sure is steady and uniform throughout. But
when a measure of one gas is presented to a
measure of another in any vessel, we have
then a surface of elastic globular particles of
one size in contact with an equal surface
of particles of another: in such case the
points of contact of the heterogeneous par-
ticles must vary all the way from 40° to
90°; an intestine motion must arise from
this inequality, and the particles of one
kind be propelled amongst those of the
other. The same cause which prevented the
two elastic surfaces from maintaining an equi-
librium, will always subsist, the particles of
one kind being from their size unable to apply
properly to the other, so that no equilibrium
can ever take place amongst the heterogeneous
particles. The intestine motion must therefore
continue till the particles arrive at the opposite
surface of the vessel against any point of which
they can rest with stability, and the equilibrium
at length is acquired when each gas is uni-
formly diffused through the other. In the
open atmosphere no equilibrium can take place
in such case till the particles have ascended so
far as to be restrained by their own weight;

--- Page 203 ---
ON MIXED ELASTIC FLUIDS. 191

that is, till they constitute a distinct atmo-
sphere. g

Tt is remarkable that when two equal
measures of different gases are thus diffused,
and sustain an invaried pressure, as that of the
atmosphere, the pressure upon each particle
after the mixture is less than before. This
points out the active principle of diffusion ;” for,
particles of fluids are always disposed to move
to that situation where the pressure is least.
Thus, in a mixture of equal measures of oxygen
and hydrogen, the common pressure on each
particle before mixture being denoted by 1,
that after the mixture when the gas becomes
of half its density, will be denoted by
s¥i= 794,

This view of the constitution of mixed gases
agrees with that which I have given before, in
the two following particulars, which I con-
sider as essential to every theory on the subject
to give it plausibility.

Ist. The diffusion of gases through cach
other is effected by means of the repulsion
belonging to the homogenous particles; or to
that principle which is always energetic to
produce the dilatation of the gas.

2d. When any two or more mixed gases
acquire an equilibrium, the elastic energy of
each against the surface of the vessel or of any

--- Page 204 ---
192 ON MIXED ELASTIC FLUIDS.

Yiquid, is precisely the same as if it were the
only gas present occupying the whole space,
and all the rest were withdrawn.

In other respects I think the last view ac-
cords better with the phenomena, and obviates
the objections which Dr. Thomson has brought
against the former; particularly in regard to
the query, why mixed gases that are known on
certain occasions to combine, do not always
combine ; and why any gaseous particle in its
nascent state is more disposed to combination
than when it has already assumed the elastic
form. It will also more clearly explain the
reason of one gas making so powerful and
durable a resistance to the entrance of another.

One difficulty still remains respecting va-
pour, which neither view of the subject al-
together removes: though vapour may subsist
in the atmosphere upon either supposition, as
far as the temperature will admit, not being
subject to any more pressure than would arise
from its own particles, were the others re-
moved, yet it may be enquired, how does it
tise from the surface of water subject to the
pressure of the atmosphere ? how does vapour
which ascends with an elastic force of only
half an inch of mercury, detach itself from
water when it has the weight of 30 inches of
mercury to oppose its ascent? This difficulty

--- Page 205 ---
ON MIXED ELASTIC FLUIDS. 193

applys nearly the same to all theories of the
solution of water in air, and it is therefore
of consequence for every one, let him adopt
what opinion he may, to remove it. Chemical
solution but ill explains it; for, the affinity of
air for vapour is always described as weak,
and yet it is sufficient to overcome the pressure
of a powerful force equal to the weight of the
atmosphere. I have endeavoured to shew in
another place (Manch. Memoirs, Vol. 1. new
series, page 284) what my own ideas on the
subject are. It appears to me, that it is not till
the depth of 10 or 12 strata of particles of
any liquid, that the pressure upon each per-
pendicular column becomes uniform; and
that several of the particles in the uppermost
stratum are in reality subject to but little
pressure.

SECTION 3.

ON THE

CONSTITUTION OF LIQUIDS,

And the Mechanical Relations betwixt Liquids
and Elastic Fluids.

A liquid or inelastic fluid may be defined
to be a body, the parts of which yield to a
very small impression, and are easily moved
one upon another. This definition may suffice
for the consideration of liquids in an hy-
drostatical sense, but not in a chemical sense.
Strictly speaking, there is no substance in-
elastic; if heat be the cause of elasticity, all
bodies containing it must necessarily be elastic:
but we commonly apply the word elastic to
such fluids only as have the property of con-
densation in a very conspicuous degree.
Water is a liquid or inelastic fluid ; but if it
is compressed by a great force, it yieldsa little,
and again recovers its original bulk when the
pressure is removed. We are indebted to
Mr. Canton for a set of experiments by which
the compressibility of several liquids is de-
monstrated. Water, he found, Jost about

--- Page 207 ---
ON LIQUIDS. 195

erigcth part of its bulk by the pressure of
the atmosphere.

When we consider the origin of water from
steam, we have no reason to wonder at its
compressibility, and that in a very small de-
gree ; it would be wonderful if water had not
this quality. The force of steam at 212° is
equal to the pressure of the atmosphere ;
what a prodigious force must it have when
condensed 15 or 18 hundred times? We
know that the particles of steam, reduced to
the state of water, still retain the greatest part
oftheir heat. What a powerful resistance then
ought they not to make against a compressing
force? The truth is, water, and by analogy,
other liquids, must be considered as bodies,
under the controul of two most powerful and
energetic agents, attraction and repulsion,
between which there is an equilibrium. If
any compressing force is applied, it yields,
indeed, but in such a manner, as a strong
spring would yield, when wound up almost
to the highest pitch. When we attempt to
separate one portion of liquid from another,
the case is different: here the attraction is the
antagonist force, and that being balanced by
the repulsion of the heat, a moderate force is
capable of producing the separation. But

--- Page 208 ---
196 ON LIQUIDS.

even here we perceive the attractive force to
prevail, there being a manifest cohesion of the
particles. Whence doesthis arise? It should
seem that when two particles of steam coalesce
to form water, they take their station so as to
effect a perfect equilibrium between the two
opposite powers ; but if any foreign force in-
tervene, so as to separate the two molecules
an evanescent space, the repulsion decreases
faster than the attraction, and consequently
this last acquires a superiority or excess, which
the foreign force has to overcome. If this
were not the case, why do they at first, or
upon the formation of water, pass from the
greater to the less distance ?

With regard to the collocation and arrange-
ment of particles in an aggregate of water or
any other liquid, I have already observed
(page 139) that this is not, in all probability,
the same asin air. It seems highly improbable
from the phenomena of the expansion of
liquids by heat. The law of expansion is
unaccountable for, if we confine liquids to
one and the same arrangement of their ultimate
particles in all temperatures; for, we cannot
avoid concluding, if that were the case,
the expansion would go on in a progressive
way withthe heat, like as in air; and there

--- Page 209 ---
MUTUAL ACTION OF FLUIDS. 197

would be no such thing observed as a point
of temperature at which the expansion was
stationary.

Reciprocal Pressure of Liquids and Elastic
Fluids.

When an elastic fluid is confined by a vessel
of certain materials, such as wood, earthen-
ware, &c. it is found slowly to communicate
with the external air, to give and receive suc-
cessively, till a complete intermixture takes
place. There is no doubt but this is oc-
casioned by those vessels being porous, so as
to transmit the fluids. Other vessels, as those
of metal, glass, &c. confine air most com-
pletely. These therefore cannot be porous ;
or rather, their pores are too small to admit of
the passage of air. I believe nosort of vessel
has yet been found to transmit one gas and
confine another; such a one is a desideratum
in practical chemistry. All the gases appear
to be completely porous, as might be expected,
and therefore operate very temporarily in con-
fining each other. How are liquids in this
respect? Do they resemble glass, or earthen-

198 MUTUAL ACTION OF FLUIDS.

ware, or gases, in regard to their power of
confining elastic fluids? Do they treat all
gases alike, or do they confine some, and
transmit others? These are important questions:
they are not to be answered in a moment.
We must patiently examine the facts,

Before we can proceed, it will be necessary
to lay down a rule, if possible, by which to
distinguish the chemical from the mechanical
action of a liquid upon an elastic fluid. I
think the following cannot well be objected
to: When an elastic fluid is kept in contact
with a liquid, if any change is perceived, either
in the elasticity or any other property of the
elastic fluid, so far the mutual action must be
pronounced cHEmicaL: but if No change is
perceived, either in the elasticity or any other
property of the elastic fluid, then the mutual
action of the two must be pronounced wholly
MECHANICAL,

Ifa quantity of lime be kept in water and
agitated, upon standing a sufficient time, the
lime falls down, and leaves the water trans-
parent: but the water takes a small portion of
of the lime which it permanently retains, con-
trary to the Laws of specific gravity. Why?
Because that portion of lime is dissolved by
the water, Ifa quantity of air be put to water

MUTUAL ACTION OF FLUIDs. 199

and agitated, upon standing a sufficient time,
the air rises up to the surface of the water and
leaves ittransparent; butthe water permanently
retains a portion of air, contrary to the Laws
of specific gravity. Why? Because that small
portion of air is dissolved by the water. So
far the two explanations are equally satisfactory.
But if we place the two portions of water
under the receiver of an air pump, and exhaust
the incumbent air, the whole portion of air
absorbed by the water ascends, and is drawn
out of the receiver; whereas the lime remains
still in solution as before. If now the question
be repeated, why is the air retained in the
water? The answer must be, because there is
an elastic force on the surface of the water
which holds it in. The water appears passive
in the business. But, perhaps, the pressure on
the surface of the water may have some effect
upon its affinity for air, and none on that for
lime? Let the air be drawn off from the
surfaces of the two portions of water, and
another species induced without alleviating
the pressure. The lime water remains un-
changed ; the air escapes from the other much
the same as in vacuo. The question of the
relation of water to air appears by this fact to
be still more difficult; at first the air seemed

to be retained by the attraction of the water ;
in the second case, the water seemed indiffer-
ent; in the third, it appears as if repulsive to
the air; yet in all three, it is the same air that
has to act on the same water. From these
facts, there seems reason then for maintaining
three opinions on the subject of the mutual
action of air and water; namely, that water
attracts air, that water does not attract it, and
that water repels air. One of these must be
true; but we must not decide hastily. Dr.
Priestley once imagined; that the clay of a
porous earthen retort, when red hot, “ destroys
for a time the aérial form of whatever air is
exposed to the outside of it; which aérial
form it recovers, after it has been transmitted
in combination from one part of the clay to
another, till it has reached the inside of the
retort.” But he soon discarded so extravagant
an opinion.

From the recent experiments of Dr. Henry,
with those of my own, there appears reason
to conclude, that a given volume of water
absorbs the following parts of its bulk of the
several gases.

These fractions are the cubes of t, 3, 4, 3, &c. this
shews the distances of the gaseous particles in the water to
be always same multiple of the distances without.

In a mixture of two or more gases, the rule
holds the same as when the gases are alone ;
that is, the quantity of each absorbed is the
same as if it was the only gas present.

As the quantity of any gas ina given volume
is subject to variation from pressure and tem-
perature, it is natural to enquire whether any
change is induced in the absorption of these

--- Page 214 ---
202 MUTUAL ACTION OF FLUIDS.

circumstances ; the experiments of Dr. Henry
have decided this point, by ascertaining, that
if the exterior gas is condensed or rarefied in
any degree, the gas absorbed is condensed or
rarefied in the same degree; so that the pro-
portions absorbed given above are absolute.

One remarkable fact, which has been hinted
at is, that no one gas is capable of retaining
another in water; it escapes, not indeed in-
stantly, like as in a vacuum, but gradually, like
as carbonic acid escapes into the atmosphere
from the bottom of a cavity communicating
with it.

It remains now to decide whether the re-
lation between water and the abovementioned
gases is of a chemical or mechanical nature.
From the facts just stated, it appears evident
that the elasticity of carbonic acid and the
other two gases of the first class is not at all
affected by the water. It remains exactly of
the same energy whether the water is present or
absent. All the other properties of those gases
continue just the same, as far as I know,
whether they are alone or blended with water:
we must therefore, I conceive, if we abide by
the Law just laid down, pronounce the mutual
action between these gases and water to be
mechanical.

A yery curious and instructive phenomenon

--- Page 215 ---
MUTUAL ACTION OF FLUIDS. 208

takes place when a portion of any of the
above three gases is thrown up into an eu-
diometer tube of ;3, of an inch diameter over
water; the water ascends and absorbs the gas
with considerable speed ; if a small portion of
common air is suddenly thrown up, it ascends
to the other, and is commonly separated by a
fine film of water foratime, That instant the
the two airs come into the above situation, the
water suddenly ceases to ascend in the tube,
but the film of water runs up with great speed,
enlarging the space below, and proportionally
diminishing that above, till it finally bursts,
This seems to shew that the film is a kind of
sieve through which those gases can easily pass,
but not common air.

In the other gases it is very remarkable their
density within the water should be such as to
require the distance of the particles to be just
2, 3 or 4 times what it is without. In olefiant
gas, the distance of the particles within is just
twice that without, as is inferred from the
density being 3. In oxygenous gas, &c. the
distance is 3 times as great, and in hydro-
genous, &c. 4 times. This is certainly curious,
and deserves further investigation ; but at pre-
sent we have only to decide whether the ge-
neral phenomena denote the relation to be of a
chemical or mechanical nature. In no case

--- Page 216 ---
204 MUTUAL ACTION OF FLUIDS.

whatever does it appear that the elasticity of
any of these gases is affected ; if water takes
ay of its bulk of any gas, the gas so absorbed,
exerts 24, of the elasticity, that the exterior
gas does, and of course it escapes from the
water when the pressure is withdrawn from
its surface, or when a foreign one is induced,
against which it is not a proper match. As
far as is known too, all the other properties of
the gases continue the same; thus, if water
containing oxygenous gas be admitted to
nitrous gas, the union of the two gases is
certain; after which the water takes up a‘
of its bulk of nitrous gas, as it would have
done, if this circumstance had not occurred.
It seems clear then that the relation is a mecha-
nical one.*

* Dr. Thomson and Mr, Murray have both written
largely in defence of the notion that all gases are combined
with water, that a real union by mcans of a chemical
affinity which water exercises in a greater or less degree
towards all gases, takes placc ; this affinity is supposed to
be of the slight kind, or of that kind which holds all gases
ina state of solution, one amongst another, without any
distinction. The oppposite doctrine was first stated in a
paper of mine, on the absorption of gases by water.
(Manch. Memoirs, new series, Vol. 1.) Previously to the
publication of that paper, Dr. Henry, who was convinced
from his own experience, that the connection of gases
‘with water was of a mechanical nature, wrote two essays in

--- Page 217 ---
MUTUAL ACTION OF FLUIDs. 205

Carbonic acid gas then presses upon water
in the first instance with its whole force ; in
ashort time it parry enters the water, and
then the reaction of the part entered, contri-

the Sth and 9th Vol. of Nicholson’s Journal, in which the
argumems for that opinien are clearly, and, I think, un-
answerably stated. Ido not intend to enter largely into a
discussion of the argunvents these gentlemen adopt. Dr.
Thonisen’s Trading argument svems to be, that “ water will
absorb such a portion of each gas, that the repulsion be-
tween the paiticles absorbed, just balances the affinity of
water for them.” He then proceeds to infer, that the
affinity of carbonic acid for water is such a3 nearly to
balance the elusticity, that the affinity of olefiant gas for
water is equal to half its elasticity, that of oxygen, 4, and
of azote 4, &c. Now if a particle of water attract one of
carbonic acid by a force analogous to that of repulsion, it
must increase directly as the distance decreases ; if so, two
snch particles must be in equilibrium at any distance ; and
if any other force is applied to the particle of gas pro-
pelling it towards the water, the two particles must unite
or co:ne into most intimate contact. Elence, I should infer,
fron) Dr. Thomson’s principle, that cach particle of water
would take one of acid, aud consequently 1b. of water
would! combine with 24lbs. of carbonic acid nearly. Mr.
Murray mentions a great many circumstances which he
conceives make against the mechanical hypothesis; for
instance, some of the acid and alkaline gases are known to
be absorbed largely by water, and undoubtedly by affinity ;
therefore the less absorbable gases must be under the same
influence, only in an inferior degree, and that “it would
be impossible to point out the line of distinction between
those where the absorption might be conccived to be purely

--- Page 218 ---
206 MUTUAL ACTION OF FLUIDS,

butes to support the incumbent atmosphere.
Finally, the gas gets completely diffused
through the water, so as to be of the same
density within as without ; the gas within the
water then presses on the containing vessel
only, and reacts upon the incumbent gas.
The water then sustains no pressure either
from the gas within or without. In olefiant
gas the surface of the water supports 7 of
the pressure, in oxygenous, &c. $$, and in
hydrogenous, &c. $3.

When any gas is confined in a vessel over

mechanical, and those where the exertion of affinity must
be allowed to operate.” I conceive nothing is more easy
than to point out the exact line of distinction: wherever
water is found to diminish or destroy the elusticity of any gas,
itis chemical agent; wherever it docs neither of these, it
is a mechanical agent. Whoever undertakes to maintain
the chemical theory of the absorption of gases hy water,
should in the outset overturn the following argument pres
ferred by Dr. Henry: “ The quantity of every gas,
absorbed by water, follows exactly the ratio of the pres
sure; and since it isa rule in philosophizing, that effects
of the same kind, though differing in degree, are pro-
duced by the same cause, it is perfectly safe to conclude,
that every, even the minutest portion of any gas, in a
state of absorption by water, is retaincd entirely by incum=
bent pressure. There is no occasion, therefore, to call in
the aid of the law of chemical affinity, when a me-
chanical law fully and satisfactorily explains the ape

pearances.”

water in the pneumatic trough, so as to com-
municate with the atmosphere through the
medium of water, that gas must constantly
be filtring through tlie water into the atmo-
sphere, whilst the atmospheric air is filtring
through the water the contrary way, to sup-
ply its place in the vessel; so that in due
time the air in the vesse] becomes atmospheric,
as various chemists have experienced. Water
in this respect is like an earthenware retort:
it admits the gases to go both ways at the
same time.

It is not easy to assign a reason why water
should be so permeable to carbonic acid, &c.
and not to the other gases; and why there
should be those differences observable in the
others. The densities 4, ,5 and ~., have
most evidently a reference to a mechanical
origin, but none whatever to a chemical one.
No mechanical equilibrium could take place
if the densities of the gases within were not
regulated by this lav; but why the gases
should not all agree in some one of these forms,
J do not see any reason.

Upon the whole it appears that water, like
earthenware, is incapable of forming a per-
fect barrier to any kind of air; but it differs
from earthenware in one respect ; the last is
alike permeable to all the gases, but water is

--- Page 220 ---
208 ON TIE CONSTITUTION OF SOLIDS.

much more permeable to some gases than to
others. Other liquids have not been sufficiently
examined in this respect.

The mutual action of water, and the greater
number of acid gases and alkaline gas partaking
most evidently of a chemical nature, will be
best considered under the heads of the respective
acids and alkalis.

SECTION 4,

ON TRE

CONSTITUTION OF SOLIDS.

Avsolid body is one, the particles of which
are in a state of equilibrium betwixt two
great powers, altraction and repulsion, but
in such a manner, that no change can be
made in their distances without considerable
force. If an approximation of the particles
is attempted by force, then the heat resists it ;
if a separation, then the attraction resists it.
‘The notion of Boscovich of alternating planes
of altraction and repulsion seems unnecessary ;
except that upon forcibly breaking the co-
hesion of any body, the newly exposed surface
must receive such a modification in its atmo-

ON THE CONSTITUTION OF SOLIDS. 209

sphere of heat, as may prevent the future junc-
tion of the parts, without great force.

The essential distinction between liquids
and solids, perhaps consists in this, that heat
changes the figure of arrangement of the ulti-
mate particles of the former continually and
gradually, whilst they retain their liquid form ;
whereas in the latter, it is probable, that change
of temperature does no more than change the
size, and not the arrangement of the ultimate
particles.

Notwithstanding the hardness of solid bodies,
or the difficulty of moving the particles one
amongst another, there are several that admit
of such motion without fracture, by the appli-
cation of proper force, especially if assisted by
heat. The ductility and malleability of the
metals, need only to be mentioned. It should
seem the particles glide along each others sur-
face, somewhat like a piece of polished iron at
the end of a magnet, without being at all
weakened in their cohesion. The absolute
force of cohesion, which constitutes the sérength
of bodies, is an enquiry of great practical im-
portance. It has been found by experiment,
that wires of the several metals beneath, being
each j, of an inch in diameter, were just
broken by the annexed weights,

--- Page 222 ---
210 ON THE CONSTITUTION OF SOLIDS.

A piece of good oak, an inch square and a
yard Ing, will just bear in the middle 330lbs,
Bur such a piece of wood should not in prac-
tice be trusted, for any length of time, with
above £ or 4 of that weight. Iron is about
10 times as strong as oak, of the same di-
mens ons.

One would be apt to suppose that strength
and hardness ought to be found propor-
tiotiate to each other ; but this is not the case.
Glass is harder than iron, yet the latter is much
the stronger of the two.

Crystallization «xhibits to us the effects of
the natural arrangement of the ultimate par-
tieles of various conpound bodies; but we
are sca cely yet sufficiently acquainted with
chemical synthesis and analysis to understand
the rationale of this process. The rhomboidal
form may arise from the proper position of
4, 6, 8 or 9 globular particles, the cubie form
from 8 particles, the triangular form from 3,

--- Page 223 ---
ON CHEMICAL SYNTHESIS. 211

6 or 10 particles, the hexahedral prism from
7 particles, &c. Perhaps, in due time, we
may be enabled to ascertain the number and
order of elementary particles, constituting any
given compound element, and from that
determine the figure which it will prefer on
crystallization, and vice versd ; but it seems
premature to form any theory on this subject,
till we have discovered from other principles
the number and order of the primary elements
which combine to form some of the compound
elements of most frequent occurrence; the
method for which we shall endeavour to point
out in the ensuing chapter.

CHAP. Ill.

ON CHEMICAL SYNTHESIS.

Wuex any body exists in the elastic state,
its ultimate particles are separated from each
other toa much greater distance than in any
other state; each particle occupies the centre
of a comparatively large sphere, and supports

--- Page 224 ---
212 ON CHEMICAL SYNTHESIS.

its dignity by keeping all the rest, which by
their gravity, or otherwise are disposed to en-
croach up it, at a respectful distance. When
we attempt to conceive the nzmber of particles
in an atmosphere, it is somewhat like attempt-
ing to conceive the number of stars in the
universe ; we are confounded with the thought.
Bat if we limit the subject, by taking a given
yolume of any gas, we seem persuaded that,
let the divisions be ever so minute, the number
of particles must be finite ; just as in a given
space of the universe, the number of stars and
planets cannot be infinite,

Chemical analysis and synthesis go no far-
ther than to the separation of particles one
from another, and to their reunion. No new
creation or destruction of matter is within the
reach of chemical agency. We might as well
attempt to introduce a new planet into the
solar system, or to annihilate one already in
existence, as to create or destroy a particle of
hydrogen. All the changes we can produce,
consist in separating particles that are in a state
of cohesion or combination, and joining those
that were previously at a distance.

In all chemical investigations, it has justly
been considered an important object to ascer-
tain the relative weights of the simples which

--- Page 225 ---
ON CHEMICAL SYNTHESIS, 213

constitute a compound. But unfortunately the
enquiry has terminated here; whereas from
the relative weights in the mass, the relative
weights of the ultimate particles or atoms of
the bodies might have been inferred, from
which their number and weight in various
other compounds would appear, in order to
assist and to guide future investigations, and to
correct their results. Now it is one great
object of this work, to shew the importance
and advantage of ascertaining ¢he relative
weights of the ultimate particles, both of simple
and compound bodies, the number of simple
elementary particles which constitute one com-
pound particle, and the number of less compound
particles which enter into the formation of one
more compound particle.

If there are two bodies, A and B, which
are disposed to combine, the following is the
order in which the combinations may take
place, beginning with the most simple:
namely,

1 atom of A 4 1 atom of B= 1 atom of C, binary.

1 atom of A + 2 atoms of B = 1 atom of D, ternary.

2 atomsof A+ 1 atom of B= I atomof E, ternary.

1 atom of A + 3 atoms of B = } atom of F, quaternary.

3 atomsof A+ 1 atom of B= 1 atom of G, quaternary.
&e. &e.

--- Page 226 ---
214 ON CHEMICAL SYNTHESIS.

The following general rules may be adopted
as guides in all our investigations respecting
chemical synthesis.

Ast. When only one combination of two
bodies can be obtained, it must be presumed to
be a binary one, unless some cause appear to
the contrary.

2d. When two combinations are observed,
they must be presumed to be a binary and a
ternary.

3d. When three combinations are obtained,
we may expect one to bea binary, and the
other two ternary.

4th. When four combinations are observed,
we should expect one binary, two ternary, and
one quaternary, &c.

5th. A binary compound should always be
specifically heavier than the mere mixture of its
two ingredients.

6th. A ¢ernary compound should be speci-
fically heavier than the mixture of a binary
and a simple, which would, if combined,
constitute it; 8c.

7th. The above rules and observations
equally apply, when two bodies, such as
C and D, D and E, &c. are combined.

From the application of these rules, to the
chemical facts already well ascertained, we

--- Page 227 ---
ON CHEMICAL SYNTHESIS. 215

deduce the following conclusions; Ist. That
water isa binary compound of hydrogen and
oxygen, and the relative weights of the two
elementary atoms are as 1: 7, nearly; 2d. That
ammonia is a binary compound of hydrogen
and azote, and the relative weights of the two
atoms are as 1: 5, nearly; 3d, That nitrous
gas is a binary compound of azote and oxygen,
the atoms of which weigh 5 and 7 respec-
tively; that nitric acid is a binary or ternary
compound according as it is derived, and con-
sists of one atom of azote and two of oxygen,
together weighing 19; that nitrous oxide is a
compound similar to nitric acid, and consists
of one atom of oxygen and two of azote,
weighing 17; that nitrous acid is a binary
compound of nitric acid and nitrous gas,
weighing $1; that oxynitric acid is a binary
compound of nitric acid and oxygen, weighing
26; 4th. That carbonic oxide is a binary com-
pound, consisting of one atom of charcoal, and
one of oxygen, together weighing nearly 12;
that carbonic acid is a ternary compound, (but
sometimes binary) consisting of one atom of
charcoal, and two of oxygen, weighing 19;
&c. &c. In all these cases the weights are
expressed in atoms of hydrogen, each of which
is denoted by unity.

--- Page 228 ---
216 ON CHEMICAL SYNTHESIS.

In the sequel, the facts and experiments
from which these conclusions are derived, will
be detailed ; as well as a great variety of others
from which are inferred the constitution and
weight of the ultimate particles of the princi
pal acids, the alkalis, the earths, the metals,
the metallic oxides and sulphurets, the long
train of neutral salts, and in short, all the
chemical compounds which have hitherto
obtained a tolerably good analysis. Several
of the conclusions will be supported by origi-
nal] experiments.

From the novelty as well as importance of
the ideas suggested in this chapter, it is deemed
expedient to give plates, exhibiting the mode
of combination in some of the more simple
cases. A specimen of these accompanies this
first part. The elements or atoms of such
bodies as are conceived at present to be simple,
are denoted by a small circle, with some dis-
tinctive mark ; and the combinations consist in
the juxta-position of two or more of these;
when three or more particles of elastic fluids
are combined together in one, it is to be sup-
posed that the particles of the same kind repel
each other, and therefore take their stations
accordingly.

EXPLANATION OF THE PLATES.

PLATE I. Fig. 1. is intended to illustrate the au-
thor’s ideas on the subject of the capacities of bodies for
heat. See page 3. There are three cylindrical vessels
placed one within another, having no communication but
over their margins ; the innermost is connected with a la-
teral and parallel tube graduated, and supposed to repre~
sent the degrees of a thermometer, the scale of which com-
mences at absolute cold; if a liquid (supposed to represent
heat) be poured into the tube, it will flow into the inner
vessel, through an aperture at the bottom, and rise to the
same level in the vessel and the tube. Equal increments
of heat in this case are supposed to produce equal incre~
ments of temperature. When the temperature has arrived
at a certain point (suppose 6000°) the body may be sup-
posed to change its solid form to the liquid, as from ice to
water, in which case its capacity for heat is increased, and
is to be represented by tlie second vessel. A considerable
portion of liquid must then be poured into the tube before
any rise will be perceived, because it flows over the mar-
gin of the innermost vessel into the lateral cavity of the
second; at length it reachés the level, and then a pro-
portional rise will ensue, till the body becomes converted
intoan elastic fluid, when the thermometer again becomes
stationary—whilst a great portion of heat is entering into
the body, now assuming a new capacity.

Fig. 2. is a comparative view of the old and new divisions
of the scale of the mercurial thermometer. See Table,
page 14. The interval from freezing to boiling water is
180° on both scales, and the extremes are numbered 32¢
and 212° respectively. There are no other points of tem-
perature in which the two scales can agree.

Fig. 3. isa view of the divisions of a water thermometer,
conformably to the new scale of the mercurial ; the lowest
point is at 45°; the intervals from 45° upwards, to 55°,
65°, 75°, &c. are as the numbers 1, 4,9, &c. Also,
30° and 60° coincide, as do 20° and 70°, &c.

PLATE If. Fig. 1. represents an air thermometer, or
the expansion of air by heat; the numbers are Fabrenheit’s,
and the intervals are such as represented in the 7th column
of the table, at page 14,

Fig. 2. is the logarithmic curve, the ordinates of which
are erected at equal intervals, and diminish progressively
by the ratio 3. The intervals of the absciss or base of the

--- Page 232 ---
218 EXPLANATION OF THE PLATES.

curve, represent equal intervals of temperature (25° for
steam or aqu ous vapour, and 34° for ethereal vapour)
the ordinates represent inches of mercury, the weight of
which is equal to the force of steam at the temperature.
See the 8ch and 91h columns of table, at page 14. Thus the
force of steam at 212°, and of ethereal vapour at 110°,
new scale, is equal tu 30 inches of mercury ; at 187° the
force of steam is half as much, or 15 inches, and at 76°,
that of ethereal vapour is also 15 inches, &c.

Fig. 3. is adevice suggested by Mr. Ewart, to illustrate
the idea which I have developed in the section on the tem-
perature of the atmosphere. It is a cylindrical vessel close
at one end and open at the other, having a moveable pis-
ton sliding within it: the vessel is supposed to contain air,
and a weight is connected with the piston as a counterpoise
to it. There is also a thermometer supposed to pass
through the side of the vessel, and to be cemented into it.
Now if we may suppose the piston to move without
friction, and the vessel to be taken up into the atmosphere,
the piston will gradually ascend, and suffer the air within
todilate, so as to correspond every where with the exterior
airin density. This dilaration tends to diminish the tem-
perature of the air within (provided no heat is acquired
from the vessel.) Such an instrument would shew what
the theory requires, namely, that the temperature of the
air within would every where in the same vertical column
agree with that without, though the former would not re-
ceive or part with any hvat absolutely, or iu any manner
communicate with the external air,

PLATE III. See page 135.—The balls in Fig. 1 and 2
represent particles of water: in the former, the square
form denotes the arrangement in water, the rhomhoidal
form in the latter, denotes the arrangement in ice. The
angle is always 60° or 120°.

resting upon two others, as 4 and 8, Fig. 1.

Fig. 4. represents the perpendicular section of a ball
resting vpon two balls, as 7 and 5, Fig. 2. The perpen-
diculars of the triangles shew the hetghts of the strata in

upon the sudden congelation of water cooled below the

220 EXPLANATION OF THE PLATES.

Enough has been given to shew the method; it will be
quite unnecessary to devise characters and combinations of
them to exhibit to view in this way all the subjects that
come under investigation ; nor is it necessary to insist upon
the accuracy of all these compounds, both in number and
weight ; the principle will be entered into more particularly
hereafter, as far as respects the individual results. It is not
to be understood that all those articles marked as simple
substances, are necessarily such by the theory ; they are
only necessarily of such weights. Soda and Potash, such
as they are found in combination with acids, are 28 and 42
respectively in weight ; but according to Mr. Davy’s very
important discoveries, they are metallic oxides; the former
then must be considered as composed of an atom of metal,
21, and one of oxygen, 7; and the latter, of an atom of
metal, 35, and one of oxygen, 7. Or, soda contains 75
per cent. metal and 25 oxygen; potash, 83.3 metal and
16.7 oxygen. It is particularly remarkable, that accord-
ing to the above-mentioned gentleman’s essay on the De-
composition and Composition of the fixed alkalies, in the
Philosophical Transactions (a copy of which essay be has
just favoured me with) it appears that “ the largest quan-
tity of oxygen indicated by these experiments was, for
potash 17, and for soda, 26 parts in 100, and the smallest
13 and 19.”

PREFACE.
W ists the ts part of this work was published, 1 ex-

pected to complete it in fittle more than a year; now two
years anda half have elapsed, and it is yet in a state of im-
perfection. The reason of it is, the great range of experi-
ments which I have found aecessary to take. Having beea
in my progress so often misled, by taking for granted the
results of others, I have determined to write as little as pos-
sible but. what [can attest by my own experience. Qn this
account, the following work will be found to contaia more
original facts and experiments, than any other of its size,
on the elementary principles of chemistry. I do not mean
to say that I have copied the minutes of my note-beok ; this
would be almost as reprehensible as writing without any
experience ; those who are conversant in practical che-
mistry, know that not more than onc new experiment in
five is fit to be reported to the public ; the rest are found,
upon due reflection, to be some way or other defective,
and are useful only as they shew the sources of error, and
the means of avoiding it.

hout
a second valume, I was desirous to finish the 5th chapter,

Finding that my design could not be completed, w:

which treats of the compounds of two elements, in the part
now edited ; but the work is enlarged so much, and the
time is so far advanced, that I have been obliged to omit
two or three important sections, particularly the metallic
oxides and sulphurets, which 1 am aware will demand no
inconsiderable share of attention. After these are disposed
of, the 6th chapter will treat of compounds of 3 or more
elements ; this will comprehend the vegetable and other
acids not yet noticed, the hydrosulphurets, the neutral salts,
compound combustibles, &c. &e.

Whatever may be the result of my plan to render the
work somewhat like complete, by the addition of another
volume, I feel great present satisfaction in having been
enabled thus far to develope that theory of chemical syn-

--- Page 246 ---
PREFACE,
thesis, which, the longer I contemplate, the more I am
convinced of its truth. Enough is already done to enable
any one to form a judgment of it. The facts and observa-
tions yet in reserve, are only of the same kind as those al-
ready advanced ; if the latter are not sufficient to convince,
the addition of the former will be but of little avail. In
the mean time, those who, with me, adopt the system,

will, Ihave no doubt, find it a very useful guide in the
prosecution of all chemical investigations,

In the arrangement of the articles treated of, I have eny
deavoured to preserve order; namely, to take such bodies
as are simple, according to our present knowledge ; and
next, those bodies that are compounds of two elements ;
but in this I have not always succeeded. For, in some in-
stances, it has not been quite clear what was simple, and
what compound ; in others, the compounds of three or more
elements have been so intimately connected with those of
two, that it was found impracticable to give a satisfactory
account of the latter, without entering more or less into a
description of the former.

In regard to nomenclature, I have generally adopted
what was most current; perhaps, in a few instances, my
peculiar views may have led me to deviate from this rule.
Thave called those salts carbonates, which are constituted
of one atom of carbonic acid united to one of base; and the
like for other salts. But some moderns call the neutral salts
carbonates, and the former subcarbonatcs ; whereas, I should
call the neutral carbonates of soda and potash supercar.
bonates, consisting of two atoms of acid and one of base.
have, however, continued to call the common nitrates by
that name, though most of them must be considered on my
system as supernitrates. I am not very anxious upon this
head, as it is evident that if the system I proceed upon be
adopted, a general reformation of nomenclature will be the
consequence, having a reference to the number of atoms, as
well as to the kind of elements, constituting the different
compound ‘bodies, Nor. 1810.

CHAP. IV.

ON ELEMENTARY PRINCIPLES.

In order to convey a knowledge of chemical
facts and experience the more clearly, it has
been generally deemed best to begin with the
description of such principles or bodies as are
the most simple, then to proceed to those that
are compounded of two simple elements, and
afterwards to those compounded of three or
more simple elements. This plan will be kept
in view in the following work, as far as is
convenient. By elementary principles, or
simple bodies, we mean such as have not been
decomposed, but are found to enter into com-
bination with other bodies, We do not know

--- Page 250 ---
222 ON ELEMENTARY PRINCIPLES,

that any one of the bodies denominated ele-
mentary, is absolutely indecomposable ; but
it ought to be called simple, till it can be
analyzed. The principal simple bodies are
distinguished by the names ozygen, hydrogen,
azole or nitrogen, carbone or charcoal, sulphur,
phosphorus, and the metals. The fixed alkalis
and the earths were lately undecomposed ;
but it has long been suspected that they were
compounds; and Mr. Davy has recently
shewn, by means of galvanic agency, that
some of them contain metals, and have all the
characters of metallic oxides; no harm can
arise, it is conceived, therefore, from placing
all the earths in the same class as the metallic
oxides,

After the elementary or simple bodies, those
compounded of two elements require next to
be considered. These compounds form a
highly interesting class, in which the new
principles adopted are capable of being exhi-
bited, and their accuracy investigated by di-
rect experiment. In this class we find several
of the most important agents in chemistry ;
namely, water, the sulphuric, nitric, muri-
atic, carbonic and phosphoric acids, most of
the compound gases, the alkalis, earths, and
metallic oxides,

In the succeeding classes we shall find the

--- Page 251 ---
ON OXYGEN. 223

more complex compounds to consist of 3, 4.
or more elementary principles, particularly the
salts ; but in these cases, it generally happens
that one compound atom unites to one simple
atom, or one compound to another compound,
or perhaps to two compound atoms ; rather
than 4 or 6 simple elementary atoms uniting
in the same instant. Thus the law of che-
mical synthesis is observed to be simple, and
always limited to small numbers of the more
simple principles forming the more com-
pound.

SECTION 1.

OXYGEN,

The most simple state in which oxygen can
be procured, is that of a gas or elastic fluid.
The gas may be obtained,

Ist. Without the application of heat. Put 2
ounces of red lead (minium) into a 5 ounce
gas bottle ; to which put one ounce of the
strongest sulphuric acid ; then instantly shake
it a little to promote mixture, and apply the
stopper with a bent tube: suddenly a great
heat is generated, white fumes fill the bottle,
and a copious flow of gas ensues, which may

--- Page 252 ---
224 ON OXYGEN.

be received in phials over water, in the usual
way. About 30 cubic inches of gas may be
expected. This gas should be exposed to a
mixture of lime and water, which absorbs
about of it (carbonic acid), and leaves the
rest nearly pure.

2. With the application of heat. Put 2
ounces of manganese (the common black oxide)
into an iron bottle, or gun barrel properly pre-
pared, to which a recurved tube is adapted.
This is then to be put into a fire, and heated
red ; oxygenous gas will come over, and may
be received as before ; it usually contains a
small portion of carbonic acid, which may be
extracted by lime water. Three or four pints
of air may thus be obtained.

3. Two ounces of manganese may be put
into a phial, with the same weight of sulphuric
acid ; the mixture being made into a paste,
apply the heat of a candle or lamp, and the
gas comes over as before, nearly pure, if taken
over water.

4. If an ounce of nitre be put into an iron
bottle, and exposed to a strong red heat, a
large quantity of gas (2 or 3 gallons) may be
obtained. It consists of about 3 parts oxygen
and 1 azote, mixed together.

5. Put 100 grains of the salt called oxy-
muriate of potash into a glass or earthenware

--- Page 253 ---
PROPERTIES OF OXYGEN. 225

retort; apply the heat of a lamp, &c. till the
retort grows nearly red, and a quantity of oxy-
genous gas will come over with great rapidity.
About 100 cubic inches will be obtained, free
from carbonic acid, and in other respects
very pure.

Various other methods are occasionally used
to obtain this gas, but the above are the
principal ; and for one who has not had much
experience, or who wants only a small quan-
tity of gas nearly pure, the first and second are
the easiest and most economical.

Properties of Oxygen.

To enumerate all the properties of oxygen,
and the combinations into which it enters,
would be to write one half of a treatise on che-
mistry. It will be sufficient, under the present
head, to point out some of its more distin-
guishing features.

1. If the specific gravity of atmospheric air
be denoted by 1, that of oxygen will be 1.127
according to Davy, but some. have found it
rather less. One hundred cubic inches of it,
at the temperature 55°, and pressure 30 inches
of mercury, weigh nearly $5 grains; the same
quantity of atmospheric air weighs 31.1 grains.
The weight of an atom of oxygen is denoted

--- Page 254 ---
226 PROPERTIES OF OXYGEN.

by 7, that of an atom of hydrogen being 1 ;
this is inferred from the relative weights of those
elements entering into combination to form
water. The diameter of a particle of oxygen,
in its elastic state, is to that of one of hydrogen,
as .794 to 1.*

2. Oxygen unites with hydrogen, charcoal,
azote, phosphorus, and other bodies denomi-
nated combustible, and that in various man-
ners and proportions; when mixed with hy-
drogen and some other elastic fluids, it ex-
plodes by an electric spark, with noise, and a
violent concussion of the vessel, together with
the extrication of much heat. This is called
detonation. {n other cases, the union of oxy-
gen with bodies is more slow, but accom-
panied by heat. This is usually called com-
bustion, as in the burning of charcoal ; and
inflammation, when accompanied with flame,
as in the burning of oi/—In other cases, the
union is still more slow, and consequently with

* For, the diamcter of an elastic particle is as 37 (weight
of one atom + specific gravity of the fluid). Whence, de-
noting the weight of an atom of hydrogen by I, and the
specific gravity of hydrogenous gas also by 1, the weight
of an atom of oxygen will be 7, and the specific gravity of
oxygenous gas, 14; we have then 34/7, : 1, or 34/¥: 1,
or .794: 1 :: diameter of an atom of oxygen : the diameter
of one of hydrogen.

--- Page 255 ---
PROPERTIES OF OXYGEN. 227

little increase of temperature, as in the rusting
of metals. This is called oxidation.

Bodies burn in the atmosphere, or air svr-
rounding the earth, in consequence of the
oxygen it contains, which is found to be rather
more than ith of the whole mass. Hence it is
not surprising, that in pure oxygen they burn
with a rapidity and splendor far superior to
what is observed in ordinary combustion. This
is easily exhibited, by plunging the ignited
body into a large phial full of oxygen; a taper,
small iron wire, charcoal, and above all phos-
phorus, burns with inconceivable brilliancy in
this gas—The nature of the new compounds
formed, will be best considered after the pro-
perties of the other elementary principles have
been enumerated.

3. That part of the atmosphere which is ne-
cessaty to the support of animal life, is oxy-
genous gas. Hence, an animal can subsist
much longer in a given quantity of pure oxy-
genous gas, than in the same quantity of com-
mon or atmospheric air. In the process of
respiration, a portion of oxygenous gas dis-
appears, and an equal one of carbonic acid is
produced ; a similar change takes place in the
combustion of charcoal; hence it is inferred,
that respiration is the source of animal heat.
Atmospheric air inspired, contains about 21

--- Page 256 ---
228 ON HYDROGEN.

per cent. oxygenous gas; the air expired, usu-
ally contains about 17 per cent. oxygen, and 4
carbonic acid. But if a full expiration of air
be made, and the last portion of the expired
air be examined, it will be found to have 8 or
9 per cent. carbonic acid, and to have lost the
same quantity of oxygenous gas.

4, Oxygenous gas is not sensibly affected by
continually passing electric sparks or shocks
through it; nor has any other operation been
found to decompose it.

SECTION 2.

HYDROGEN.

Hydrogenous gas may be procured by tak-
ing half an ounce of iron or zinc filings, turn-
ings, or other small pieces of these metals,
putting them into a phial, with two or three
ounces of water, to which pour one quarter as
much sulphuric acid, and an effervescence
will be produced, with abundance of the gas,
which may be received over water in the
usual way.

Some of its distinguishing properties are :—

1. It is the lightest gas with which we
are acquainted. Its specific gravity is nearly
.0805, that of atmospheric air being 1, This

--- Page 257 ---
PROPERTIES OF HYDROGEN. 229

is nearly the mean attained from the results of
different philosophers. Whence we find, that
100 cubic inches of this gas weigh nearly 24
grains at the mean temperature and pressure.
It may be stated to be +',th of the weight of
oxygen, and ,th that of azote, and nearly
the same fractional part of the weight of com-
monair. The weight of an atom of hydrogen
is denoted by 1, and is taken for a standard of
comparison for the other elementary atoms.
The diameter of an atom of hydrogen, in its
elastic state, is likewise denoted by unity,
and considered as a standard of comparison
for the diameters of the atoms of other elastic
fluids.

2. It extinguishes burning bodies, and is
fatal to animals that breathe it.

3. Ifa phial be filled with this gas, and a
lighted taper, or red hot iron, be brought to
its mouth, the gas will take fire, and burn
gradually till the whole is consumed. The
flame is usually reddish, or yellowish white.

4, When oxygen and hydrogen gas are
mixed together, no change is perceived ; but

*if a lighted taper is brought to the mixture, or

an electric spark passed through it, a violent
explosion takes place. The two gases unite
in a proportion constantly the same, and pro-
duce steam, which in a cold medium is in-

--- Page 258 ---
230 PROPERTIES OF HYDROGEN.

stantly condensed into water. When 2 mea-
sures of hydrogen are mixed with 1 of oxygen,
and exploded over water, the whole gas dis-
appears, and the vessel becomes filled with
water, in consequence of the formation and
subsequent condensation of the steam.

If 2 measures of atmospheric air be mixed
with 1 of hydrogen, and the electric spark
made to pass through the mixture, an explo-
sion ensues, and the residuary gas is found to
be 13 measures, consisting of azote and a small
portion of hydrogen. ‘The portion of the mix-
ture which disappears, 12, being divided by
3, gives 42 nearly, denoting the oxygen in
two measures of atmospheric air, or 21 per
cent. The instrument for exploding such mix-
tures in is called Volta’s eudiometer.

5. Another remarkable property of hydrogen
deserves notice, though it is not peculiar to it,
but belongs in degree to all other gases that
differ materially from atmospheric air in spe-
cific gravity ; if a cylindrical jar of 2 or more
inches in diameter, be filled with hydrogen,
placed upright and uncovered for a moment or
two, nearly the whole will vanish, and its
place be supplied by atinospheric air. In this
case it must evidently leave the vessel in a
body, and the other enter in the same manner.
But if the jar of hydrogen be held with its

--- Page 259 ---
ON AZOTE OR NITROGENE. 231

mouth downwards, it slowly and gradually
wastes away, and atmospheric air enters in the
same manner ; after several minutes there will
be found traces of hydrogen remaining in the
jar. If a tube of 12 inches long and + inch
internal diameter, be filled with hydrogen,
there is little difference perceived whether it is
held up or down ; the gas slowly and gradually
departs in each case, and as much may be
found after 10 minutes have expired, as would
be after 2 or 3 seconds if the tube were an
inch or more in diameter. If a 3 or 4 ounce
phial be filled with hydrogen, and a cork
adapted, containing a tube of 2 or 3 inches
long and 4, inch internal diameter, it does not
make any material difference in the waste of
the gas whether the phial is held up or down ;
it will be some hours before the hydrogen gets
dispersed.

6. Hydrogen gas bears electrification with-
out any change.

" SECTION

ON AZOTE OR NITROGENE,

Azotic or nitrogene gas may be procured
from atmospheric air, of which it constitutes
the greater part, by various processes : Ist. To

--- Page 260 ---
232 PROPERTIES OF AZOTE,

100 measures of atmospheric air put 30 of
nitrous gas ; the mixture having stood some
time, must be passed two or three times
through water ; it will still contain a small
portion of oxygen ; to the residuum put 5 more
ineasures of nitrous gas, and proceed as before ;
small portions of the residuum must then be
tried separately, by nitrous gas and by atmo-
spheric air, to see whether any diminution
takes place ; whichever produces a diminution
after the mixture, shews that it is wanting,
and the other redundant ; consequently a small
addition to the stock must be made accord-
ingly. By a few trials the due proportion may
be found, and the gas being then well washed,
may be considered as pure azotic. 2. If a
quantity of liquid sulphuret of lime (a yellow
liquid procured by boiling one ounce of a mix-
ture of equal parts sulphur and lime in a quart
of water, till it becomes a pint) be agitated in
2 or 3 times its bulk of atmospheric air for some
time, it will take out all the oxygen, and leave
the azotic gas pure. 3. If to 100 measures of
atmospheric air. 42 of hydrogen be put. and
an electric spark passed through the mixture,
an explosion will take place, and there will be
left 80 measures of azotic gas, &c.

The properties of this gas are ;—

1. The specific gravity of azotic gas at the

--- Page 261 ---
PROPERTIES OF AZOTE. 233

temperature of 55° and pressure 30 inches, is
.967 according to Davy, that of air being 1.
The weight of 100 cubic inches is nearly 30
grains. The weight of an atom of azote is
denoted by 5, that of an atom of hydrogen
being 1; this is inferred chiefly from the com-
pound denominated ammonia, and from those
of azote and oxygen, as will be seen here-
after. The diameter of a particle of azote in
its elastic state, is to that of one of hydrogen,
as .747 to Ll.

2. Like hydrogen, it extinguishes burning
bodies, and is fatal to animals that breathe it.

3. Azotic gas is less prone to combination
than most, if not all, other gases; it never
combines with any other gas simply of itself;
but if a mixture of it and oxygen has the
electric spark passed through it for a long con-
tinuance, a siow combustion of the azote takes
place, and nitric acid is formed. In other
cases azote may be obtained in combination
with oxygen in various proportions, and the
compqunds can be analyzed, but are not so
easily formed in the synthetic way.

4. Azotic gas, as has been noticed, consti-
tutes nearly 4ths of atmospheric air, notwith-
standing its being fatal to animals that breathe
it in its unmixed state ; the other 3th is oxy-
genous gas, which is merely mixed with and

--- Page 262 ---
234 ON CARBONE OR CHARCOAL.

diffused through the former, and this mixture
constitutes the principal part of the atmosphere,
and is suited, as we perceive, both for animal
life and combustion.

5. Azotic gas is not affected by repeated
electrification.

SECTION 4.

ON CARBONE OR CHARCOAL.

If apiece of wood be put into a crucible,
and covered with sand, and the whole gra-
dually raised to a red heat, the wood is de-
composed ; water, an acid, and several elastic
fluids are disengaged, particularly carbonic
acid, carburetted hydrogen, and carbonic oxide.
Finally, there remains a black, brittle, porous
substance in the crucible, called charcoal,
which is incapable of change by heat in close
vessels, but burns in the open air, and is con-
verted into an elastic fluid, carbonic acid.
Charcoal constitutes from 15 to 20 per cent. of
the weight of the wood from which it was
derived.

Charcoal is insoluble in water ; it is without
taste or smell, but contributes much to correct
putrefaction in animal substances. It is less
liable to decay than wood by the action of air

--- Page 263 ---
ON CARBONE OR CIIARCOAL, 235

and water. When new, it gradually absorbs
moisture from the atmosphere, amounting to
12 or 15 per cent. of its weight. One half of
the moisture may be expelled again by the
heat of boiling water, if long continued ; the
other requires a higher temperature, and then
carries with ita portion of charcoal. I took
350 grains of charcoal that had been exposed
to the atmosphere fer a long time ; this was
subjected to the heat of boiling water for one
hour and a half; it lost 7 grains in the first
quarter of an hour, 6 in the second, and finally
it had lost 25 grains.

Several authors have maintained that char-
coal, after being heated red, has the property
of absorbing most species of elastic fluids, in
such quantities as to exceed its bulk several
times ; by which we are to understand a che-
mical union of the elastic fluids with the char-
coal. The results of their experiments on this
head, are so vague and contradictory, as to
leave little credit even to the fact of any such
absorption. 1 made 1500 grains of charcoal
red hot, then pulverized it, and put it into
a Florence flask with a stopcock ; to this a
bladder filled with carbonic acid was con-
nected ; this experiment was continued for a
week, and occasionally examined by weighing
the flask and its contents. At first there ap-

--- Page 264 ---
236 ON CARBONE OR CHARCOAL.

peared an increase of weight of 6 or 7 grains,
from the acid mingling with the common air
in the flask, of less specific gravity ; but the
succeeding increase was not more than 6
grains, and arose from the moisture which
permeated the bladder: for the bladder
continued as distended as at first, and finally
upon examination was found to contain no-
thing but atmospheric air. Yet carbonic acid
is stated to be the most absorbable by char-
coal. One of the authors above alluded to,
asserts that the heat of boiling water is suffi-
cient to expel the greater part of the gases so
absorbed. Now this is certainly not true, as
Allen and Pepys have shewn ; and most prac-
tical chemists know that no air is to be obtained
from moist charcoal below a red heat. Hence
the weight acquired by fresh made charcoal,
is in all probability to be wholly ascribed to
the moisture which it absorbs from the atmo-
sphere ; and it is to the decomposition of this
water, and the union of its elements with char-
coal, that we obtain such an abundance of
gases by the application of a red heat.

It was the prevailing opinion some time
ago that charcoal was an oxide of diamond;
but Mr. Tennant, and more recently Messrs.
Allen and Pepys, have shewn that the same
quantity of carbonic acid is obtained from the

--- Page 265 ---
ON CARBONE OR CHARCOAL, 237

combustion of the diamond as from that of an
equal weight of charcoal; we must: therefore
conclude, that the diamond and charcoal are
the same element in different states of aggre-
gation.

Berthollet contends that charcoal contains
hydrogen; this doctrine is farther counte-
nanced by some experiments of Berthollet jun.
in the Annales de Chimie, Feb. 1807; Mr.
Davy’s experience seems also on the same side.
But their observations do not appear to me to
warrant any other conclusion than that it is
extremely difficult to obtain and operate upon
charcoal entirely free from water. Hydrogen
appears no more essential to charcoal than air
is essential to water.

From the various combinations of charcoal
with other elements hereafter to be mentioned,
the weight of its ultimate particle is deduced
to be 5, or perhaps 5.4, that of hydrogen being
denoted by unity.

Charcoal requires a red heat, just visible by
day light, to burn it: this corresponds to 1000°
of Fahrenheit nearly.

238 ON SULPHUR.

SECTION 5.

ON SULPHUR.

Sulphur or brimstone is an article well
known; it is an element pretty gencrally dis-
seminated, but is most abundant in volcanic
countries, and in certain minerals. A great
part of what is used in this country is imported
from Italy and Sicily ; the rest is obtained from
the ores of copper, lead, iron, &c.

Sulphur is fused by a heat a little above that
of boiling water. It is usually run into cylin-
drical moids, and upon cooling becomes roét
sulphur, In this case the rolls become highly
electrical by friction: they are remarkably
brittle, frequently falling in pieces by the con-
tact of the warm hand. Its specific gravity is
1.98 or 1.99.

Sulphur is sublimed by a heat more than
sufficient to fuse it ; the sublimate constitutes
the common flowers of sulphur. The effects
of the different gradations of heat on sulphur
are somewhat remarkable. It is fused at 226°
or 228° of Fahrenheit, into a thin fluid ; it be-
gins to grow thick, darker, and viscid at
about 350°, and continues so till 600° or up-
wards, the fumes becoming gradually more

--- Page 267 ---
ON SULPHUR. 239

copious. This viscid mass, if poured into wa-
ter, continues to retain a degree of tenacity
after being cooled ; but finally it becomes of a
hard and smooth texture, much less brittle than
common roll sulphur.

For any thing certainly known yet, sulphur
appears to be an elementary substance, It
enters into composition with various bodies ;
and from a comparison of several compounds, I
deduce the weight of an atom of sulphur to be
nearly 14 times that of hydrogen ; itis possible
it may be somewhat more or less, but I think
the error of the above cannot exceed 2. Mr.
Davy seems to conclude, from galvanic expe-
riments on sulphur, that it contains oxygen ;
this may be the case, from the great weight of
the elementary particles ; but it should contain
50 per cent. oxygen, or none at all.

Berthollet jun. seems to conclude that sul-
phur contains hydrogen (Annal. de Chimie,
Feb. 1807). Mr. Davy inclines to this idea
(Philos. Transac. 1807). That some traces of
hydrogen may he discovered in sulphur there
cannot be much doubt. Dr. Thomson has
well observed the difficulty of obtaining sul-
phur free from sulphuric acid ; but if sulphu-
ric acid be present, water must also be found,
and consequently hydrogen. A strong argu-
ment against the existence of hydrogen as an

--- Page 268 ---
240 ON PHOSPHORUS.

essential in sulphur, is derived from the consi-
deration of the low specific heat of sulphur.
If this article contained 7 or 8 per cent, of
hydrogen, or 50 per cent. of oxygen, or as
much water, it would not have the low spe-
cific heat of .19.

Sulphur burns in the open air at the tempe-
rature of 500°; it unites with oxygen, hydro-
gen, the alkalis, earths and metals, forming a
great variety of interesting compounds, which
will be considered in their respective places.

SECTION 6.

ON PHOSPHORUS.

Phosphorus is an article having much the
same appearance and consistency as white
wax. It is usually prepared from the bones of
animals, which contain one of its compounds,
phosphate of lime, by a laborious and complex
process. The bones are calcined in an open
fire; when reduced to powder, sulphuric acid
diluted with water is added ; this acid takes
part of the lime, and forms an insoluble com-
pound, but detaches superphosphate of lime,
which is soluble in water. This solution is
evaporated, and the salt is obtained in a glacial
state. The solid is reduced to powder, and

--- Page 269 ---
ON PHOSPHORUS, 241

mixed with half its weight of charcoal ; then
the mixture is put into an earthenware retort,
and distilled by a strong red heat, when the
phosphorus comes over, and is received in the
water into which the tube of the retort is
immersed.

Phosphorus is so extremely inflammable,
that it is required to be preserved in water:
It melts about blood heat ; and in close ves-
sels it can be heated up to 550°, when it boils,
and of course distils. When exposed to the
air, it undergoes slow combustion ; but if
heated to 100° or upwards, it is inflamed,
burns with rapidity and the emission of great
heat, accompanied with white fumes. It com-
bines with oxygen, hydrogen, sulphur and
other combustible bodies, and with several of
the metals.

Phosphorus is soluble in expressed and other
oils, in alcohol, ether, &c.; these solutions,
when agitated with common air or oxygenous
gas, appear luminous in the dark: a portion
of the oil being rubbed upon the hand, makes
it appear luminous.

The specific gravity of phosphorus is 1.7
nearly ; the weight of its ultimate particle or
atom is about 9 times that of hydrogen, as will
appear when its compounds with oxygen are
considered,

--- Page 270 ---
242 ON THE METALS.

SECTION 7.

ON THE METALS.

The metals at present known, amount at
least to 30 in number ; they form a class of
bodies which are remarkably distinguishable
from others in several particulars, as well as
from each other.

Gravity. One of the most striking pro-
perties of metals is their great weight or specific
gravity. The lightest of them (excluding the
lately discovered metals, potasium and sodium)
weighs at least six times as much as water, and
the heaviest of them 23 times as much. On
the supposition that all aggregates are consti-
tuted of solid particles or atoms, each sur-
rounded by an atmosphere of heat, it is a cu-
rious and important enquiry, whether this su-
perior specific gravity of the metals is occa-
sioned by the greater specific gravity of their
individual solid particles, or from the greater
number of them aggregated into a given vo-
lume, owing to some peculiar relation they
may have to heat, or their superior attraction
for each other. Upon examination of the facts
exhibited by the metals, in their combinations

--- Page 271 ---
GENERAL PROPERTIES OF THE METALS, 243

with oxygen, sulphur, and the acids, it will
appear that the former of these two positions
is the true one ; namely, that the atums of
metals are heavier, almost in the same ratio as
their specific gravities: thus an atom of lead
will be found to be 11 or 12 times heavier
than one of water, and its specific gravity is
equally so. It must however be admitted,
that in metals and other solid bodies, as well
as in gases, their specific gravities are by no
means exaclly proportional to the weights of
their atoms. It is further remarkable of the
metals, that notwithstanding the great weight
of their ultimate particles relatively, those par-
ticles possess no more, but often Jess, heat
than particles of hydrogen, oxygen, or water. If
the heat surrounding a particle of water of any
temperature be denoted by 1, that surrounding
a particle of lead will be found only $ as much,
though the atom of lead is 12 times the weight
of that of water. One would be apt to con-
clude from this circumstance, that an atom of
lead has less attractive power for heat than an
atom of water; but this does not necessarily
follow ; nay, the reverse is perhaps more pro-
bable of the two ; for, the absolute quantity
of heat around any one particle in a state of
aggregation, depends greatly upon the force
of affinity, or the attraction of aggregation ;

--- Page 272 ---
244 GENERAL PROPERTIES OF THE METALS,

if this be great, the heat is partly expressed or
squeezed out ; but if little, it is retained,
though the attraction of the particles for heat
remains unaltered. An atom of water may
have the same attraction for heat that one of
lead has ; but the latter may have a stronger
attraction of aggregation, by which a quantity
of heat is expelled, and consequently less heat
retained by any aggregate of the particles.
Opacity and Lustre. Metals are remark-
ably opake, or destitute of that property which
glass and some other bodies possess, of trans-
mitting light. When reduced to Jeaves as
thin as possible, such as gold and silver leaf,
they continue to obstruct the passage of light.
Though the metallic atoms, with their atmo-
spheres of heat, are nearlv the same size as the
atoms of water and their atmospheres, yet it
seems highly probable that the metallic atoms
abstracted from their atmospheres, are much
larger than those of water in Jike circumstances.
The former, I conceive, are large particles
with highly condensed atmospheres ; the Jat-
ter, are small particles with more extensive
atmospheres, because of their less powerful
attraction for heat. Hence, it may be sup-
posed, the opacity of metals and their lustre
are occasioned. A great quantity of solid
matter and a high condensation of heat, are

--- Page 273 ---
GENERAL PROPERTIES OF THE METALS. 245

likely to obstruct the passage of light, and to
reflect it.

Malleability and Ductility, Metals are dis-
tinguished for these properties, which many of
them possess in aneminent degree. By means
of a hammer, they may be flattened and ex-
tended without losing their cohesion, especially
if assisted by heat. Cylindrical rods of metal
can be drawn through holes of less diameter,
by which they are extended in length; and
this successively till they form very small wire.
These properties render them highly useful.
Metals become harder and denser by being
hammered.

Tenacity. Metals exceed most other bodies
in their tenacity or force of cohesion; however
they differ materially from each other in this
respect. An iron wire of oth of an inch in
diameter, will support 5 or 6 hundred pounds.
Lead is only -/,th part as strong, and not equal
to some sorts of wood.

Fusibility. Metals are fusible or capable of
being melted by heat; but the temperatures
at which they melt are extremely different.

Most of the metals possess a considerable
degree of hardness ; and some of them, as iron,
are susceptible of a high degree of elasticity 5
they are mostly excellent conductors of heat
and of electricity.

--- Page 274 ---
246 GENERAL PROPERTIES OF THE METALS,

Metals combine with various portions of
oxygen, and form metallic oxides ; they also
combine with sulphur, and form sulphurets 5
some of them with phosphorus, and form phos-
phurets ; with carbone or charcoal, and form
carburets, &c. which will be treated of in their
respective places. Metals also form compounds
one with another, called alloys.

The relative weights of the ultimate particles
of the metals may be investigated, as will be
shewn, from the metallic oxides, from the me-
tallic sulphurets, or from the metallic salts ;
indeed, if the proportions of the several com-
pounds can be accurately ascertained, I have
no doubt they will all agree in assigning the
same relative weight to the elementary particle
of the same metal. In the present state of our
knowledge, the results approximate to each
other remarkably well, especially where the
different compounds have been examined with
care, and can be depended upon; but the pro-
portions of the elements in some of the metallic
oxides, sulphurets, and salts, have not yet been
found with any degree of precision.

The number of metals hitherto discovered is
30, including the two derived from the fixed
alkalis ; some of these may, perhaps, be im-
properly denominated metals, as they are
scarce, and have not been subjected to so much

--- Page 275 ---
GENERAL PROPERTIES OF THE METALS. 247

experience as others. The greater part of these
metals have been discovered within the last
century. Dr. Thomson divides the metais into
4 classes; 1. Malleable metals: 2. Brittle and
easily fusible metals : 3. Brittle and difficultly
fusible metals : 4. Refractory metals; that is,
such as are known only in combination, it
having not yet been found practicable to ex-
hibit them in a separate state-—They may be
arranged as follows :

1, Malleable.

1, Gold. 9. Copper.

2. Platinum. 10. Iron.

_3. Silver. 11. Nickel.

4. Mercury. 12, Tin.

5. Palladium. 13. Lead.

1. Titanium. 3. Tantalium.
2, Columbium. 4. Cerium.

To which last class also may the supposed
metals from the earths be referred.

More particular Properties of the Metals,

Gop. This metal has been known from
the earliest times, and always highly valued.
Its scarcity, and several of its properties, con-
tribute to make it a proper medium of ex-
change, which is one of its chief uses. Eng-
lish standard gold consists of 11 parts by
weight of pure gold, and 1 part of copper (or
silver) alloyed. This is usually spoken of as
being 22 carats fine, pure gold being 24 carats
fine. The use of the copper is to render the
alloy harder, and consequently more durable
than pure gold.

Gold retains its splendid yellow colour and
lustre in all states of the atmosphere unchanged.
Its specific gravity, when pure, and ham-
mered, is 19.8, or more; but that of the same
gold, in other circumstances, may be 19,2.—
‘The specific gravity of standard gold varies
from 17.1 to 17.9, accordingly as it is alloyed
with copper, copper and silver, or silver, as
well as from other circumstances. Jt excels
all other metals in malleability and ductility ;
it may be beaten out so thin, that a leaf weigh-
ing 1 grain, shall cover 50 or 6O square inches,
in which case the leaf is only +y¢scoth part of
an inch in thickness : but it is capable of be-

--- Page 278 ---
250 GOLD. PLATINA.

ing reduced to ,',th of that thickness on silver
wire. Gold melts at 32° of Wedgwood’s py-
rometer ; that is, a red heat, but one greatly
inferior to what may be obtained by a smith’s
forge: when fused, it may continue in that
state for several weeks without losing any ma-
terial weight. There is reason to believe that
gold combines with oxygen, sulphur, and
phosphorus ; but those compounds are diffi-
cultly obtained. It combines with most of
the metals, and forms alloys of various de-
scriptions.

The weight of an atom of gold is not easily
ascertained, because of the uncertainty in the
proportions of the elements forming the com-
pounds into which it enters. It is probably
not less than 140, nor more than 200 times the
weight of an atom of hydrogen,

Piativa. This metal has not been found
any where but in South America. In its crude
state, it consists of small flattened grains of a
metallic lustre, and a grey-white colour. This
ore is found to be an alloy of several metals,
of which platina is usually the most abundant.
The grains are dissolved in nitro-muriatic acid,
except a black matter which subsides ; the
clear liquor is decanted, and a solution of sal
ammoniac is dropped into it : a yellow preci-
pitate falls ; this is heated to redness, and the

--- Page 279 ---
PLATINA. eon

powder is platina nearly pure. To obtain it
still more pure, the process must be repeated
upon this platina, When these grains are
wrapped up in a thin plate of platina, heated
to redness, and cautiously hammered, they
unite and form a solid mass of malleable metal.
Platina thus obtained, is of a white colour,
rather inferior to silver. In hardness it some-
what exceeds silver; but in specific gravity
it exceeds all other bodies hitherto known.
Specimens of it, when hammered, have been
found of the specific gravity of 23 or upwards.
It is nearly as ductile and malleable as gold.
It requires a greater heat than most metals to
fuse it; but when heated to whiteness, it
welds in the same manner as iron, It is not
in any degree altered by exposure to the air or
to water. No ordinary artificial heat seems
capable of burning it or uniting it to oxygen.
Its oxidizement, however, may be effected
by means of galvanism and electricity, and by
exposing it to the heat excited by the com-
bustion of hydrogen and charcoal in oxygenous
gas. Platina has been united to phosphorus,
but not to hydrogen, carbone, or sulphur. It
unites with most of the metals to form alloys.
The weight of the ultimate particle of pla-
tina cannot be ascertained from the data we
have at present: from its combination with

--- Page 280 ---
25g SILVER.

oxygen, it should seem to be about 100 ; but,
judging from its great specific gravity, one
would be inclined to think it must be more,
Indeed the proportion of oxygen in the oxides
of platina cannot be considered as ascertained.

Platina is chiefly used for chemical pur-
poses ; in consequence of its infusibility, and
the difficulty of oxidizing it, crucibles and
other utensils are made of it, in preference to
every other metal. Platina wires are extremely
useful in electric and galvanic researches, for
like reasons.

Sitver. This metal is found in various parts
of the world, and in various combinations ;
but the greatest quantity is derived from Ame-
rica. Its uses are generally known. ‘The
specific gravity of melted silver is 10.474 ; after
being hammered, 10.511. English standard
silver, containing +', copper, simply fused, is
10.2. Pure silver is extremely malleable and
ductile ; but inferior in these respects to gold.
It melts at a moderately red heat. It is not
oxidized by exposure to the air, but is tar-
nished or loses its lustre, which is occasioned
by the sulphureous vapours floating in the air.
It unites with sulphur in a moderate heat ;
and may be oxidized by means of galvanism
and electricity ; it burns with a green flame.

--- Page 281 ---
MERCURY. 253

Silver combines with phosphorus, and forms
alloys with most of the metals.

The relative weight of an atom of silver
admits of a pretty accurate approximation,
from the known proportions of certain com-
pounds into which silver enters ; namely, the
oxides and sulphuret of silver, and the salts of
silver: all of these neatly concur in deter-
mining the weight of an atom of silver to be
100 times that of hydrogen.

Mercury. This metal, which is also
known under the name of quicksilver, has
been long discovered and in use. It is white
and brilliant, reflecting more light from its
surface, perhaps, than any other metal. Its
specific gravity is 13.58. It is fluid at the
common temperature of the atmosphere ; but
it congeals when reduced to the temperature
of —39° Fahrenheit. It contracts suddenly at
the point of congelation, contrary to what is
exhibited in water; when congealed, mer-
cury becomes malleable ; but its qualities in a
solid state are not easily to be ascertained.
When heated in the open air to the tempera-
ture of 660°, or thereabouts, according to the
equidifferential scale, mercury boils, and dis-
tils rapidly ; like water, however, it rises in
vapour in a greater or less degree at all tempe-
ratures. Pure liquid mercury has no taste nor

--- Page 282 ---
254 PALLADIUM, RHODIUM.

smell ; it may be taken internally, without
producing any remarkable effect on the human
body. It can be united with oxygen, sulphur,
and phosphorus ;.and it forms alloys, or, as
they are more commonly called, qmalgams,
with most of the metals.

The weight of an atom of mercury is deter-
minable from its oxides, its sulphuret, and the
various salts which it forms with acids : from
a comparison of all which, it seems to be ahout
167 times the weight of hydrogen. From any
thing certainly known, the mercurial atom is
heavicr than any other ; though there are two
or three metals which exceed it in specific
gravity.

Pattapium. This metal was discovered a
few years ago in crude platina, by Dr. Wollas-
ton, of which an account may be seen in the
Philos. Transact. for 1804. Jt is a white
metal, resembling platina in appearance, but
is much harder : it is only one half of the spe-
cific gravity of platina. It requires great heat
to fuse it, and is difficultly oxidized. Palla-
dium combines with oxygen and sulphur, and
forms alloys with several of the metals. But
we have not yet sufficient data to determine
the weight of its ultimate particles,

Ruopium. This metal has been discovered
still more recently than the last in crude pla-

--- Page 283 ---
IRIDIUM AND OSMIUM. 255

tina, by Dr. Wollaston.—It constitutes about
ztoth part of crude platina. It possesses nearly
the same colour and specific gravity as palla-
dium, and agrees with it in other particulars ;
but in certain respects they appear to possess
essentially distinct properties—The weight of
the ultimate particles of this metal cannot yet
be ascertained.

Iripium and Osmium. These two metals
were lately discovered by Mr. Smithson Ten-
nant to exist in crude platina. When crude
platina is dissolved in nitro-muriatic acid,
there remains a quantity of black shining
powder ; this, powder contains two metals,
one of which Mr. Tennant called Iridium,
from the variety of colours which its solutions
exhibited ; the other Osmzwmn, from a peculiar
smell which accompanies its oxides, Iridium
isa white metal, infusible as platina, dificultly
soluble in any acid: it seems to combine with
oxygen, and to form alloys with some of the
metals, Osmium has a dark grey or blue co-
Jour: when heated in the air, it combines
with oxygen, and the oxide is volatile, posses-
sing the characteristic smell. In a close vessel,
it resists any heat that has been applied ; it
also resists the action of acids, but unites with
potash. It amalgamates with mercury. The

--- Page 284 ---

weights of the atoms of these two metals are
unknown.

Correr. This metal has been long known.
It is of a fine red colour ; its taste is styptic
and nauseous. Its specific gravity varies from
8.6 to 8.9. It possesses great ductility, can
be drawn into wire as fine as hair, and is ca-
pable of being beaten into very thin leaves.
It is fused in a temperature higher than silver,
and lower than gold, about 27° of Wedg-
wood’s thermometer. Copper unites with
oxygen, sulphur, and phosphorus ; and forms
alloys with several other metals.

The weight of the ultimate particle of cop-
per, may be ascertained with considerable pre-
cision, from the proportions in which it is
found combined with oxygen, sulphur, and
phosphorus ; as well as from its combinations
with the acids. From a comparison of these,
its weight seems to be nearly 56 times that of
hydrogen.

Iroy. This metal, the most useful we are
acquainted with, has been long known. It
seems to be found almost in every coun'ry,
and in a great variety of combinations. Its
ores require great heat to expel the foreign
matters, and to melt the iron, which is first
obtained in masses or pigs, called cast iron ;

--- Page 285 ---
TRON. 257

after which it undergoes a laborious operation,
the object of which is to expel the carbone
and oxygen which it may yet contain, and to
render it malleable. ‘I'his consists chiefly in
hammering the ifon when heated almost to
fusion.

Tron is susceptible of a high polish ; it is
very hard; it varies in specific gravity from
7.6 to 7.8. It is distinguishable from all other
metals, by possessing, in a high degree, (in-
deed almost exclusively) magnetical attraction.
The magnet or loadstone itself is chiefly iron,
with certain modifications. Iron increases in
malleability as it increases in temperature : its
ductility is surpassed by few other metals, as
its wire admits of extension till it becomes as
fine as human hair: its tenacity, which is one
of its most valuable properties, is not equalled
by any other body we are acquainted with,
Pure malleable iron is estimated to melt at
158° of Wedgwood ; whereas cast iron melts
about 130°.

Iron is distinguished for its combinations
with oxygen, carbone, sulphur, and phos-
phorus: it forms alloys with several of the
metals, but they are not of much importance.

The weight of an atom of iron may be
found from almost any of its numerous com-
Dinations, either its oxides, its sulphurets, or

--- Page 286 ---
258 NICKEL, TIN.

any of the salts which it forms with acids : all
these will be found to give the same weight
nearly ; namely, 50 times the weight of an
atom of hydrogen.

Nicxer. The ore from which this metal is
obtained, is found in Germany: it usually
contains several other metals, from which it is
difficult to extract the nickel in a state of
tolerable purity, Nickel, when pure as it can
be obtained, is of a silver white colour ; its
specific gravity is 8.279, and when forged
2.666. It is malleable, both hot and cold,
and may be beaten into a leaf of 2, of an inch
in thickness. A very great heat is required to
fuse it. It is attracted by the magnet nearly
as much as iron, and may be concerted into a
magnet itself. It combines with oxygen, sul-
phur, and phosphorus ; and may be alloyed
with certain other metals.

The weight of its atom can scarcely yet be
determined, for want of a more accurate know-
ledge of the compounds into which it enters ;
perhaps it will be found to weigh about 25, or
else doubie that number, 50.

Tix. This metal has been long known,
though it is found but in few places compara-
tively. Cornwall is the only part of Great
Britain where this metal abounds ; and its tin
mines are the most celebrated in Europe. Tin

LEAD. 259

is a white metal, nearly resembling silver ; its
specific gravity is about 7.3. It is malleable
in a high degree ; but inferior to many metals
in ductility and tenacity. It melts at the low
temperature of 440° Fahrenheit. When ex-
posed to the air, it loses its lustre, and be-
comes grey ; this is more rapidly the case if it
be melted ; its surface then soon becomes grey,
and in time passes to yellow. Tin combines
with oxygen, sulphur, and phosphorus, and
forms alloys with most of the metals.

The weight of an atom of tin may be de-
rived from the proportion of the elements in
the oxides, the sulphuret or the phosphuret of
tin; or from the Salts of tin. It is probably
about 50 times heavier than hydrogen.

Leap. This metal seems to have been
known in early times: it is of a blueish white
colour, bright when recently melted, but soon
loses its lustre when exposed to the air. It has
scarcely any taste or smell ; but operates as a
deadly poison when taken internally : it seems
to benumb the vital functions, and to destroy
the nervous sensibility, inducing a paralysis,
and finally death. he specific gravity of
lead, whether hammered or not, is about 11.3
or 11.4; it is malleable, and may be reduced
to thin plates. It melts about 610° of Fahren-
heit. Jt combines with oxygen, sulphur, and

phosphorus, and forms alloys with most other
metals.

The ultimate particle of lead, as deduced
from a comparison of its oxides, sulphuret, and
the salts in which it is found, I estimate at 95
times that of hydrogen.

Zisc. ‘The ores of this metal are not rare ;
but the metal has not been extracted from them
in a pure state, at least in Britain, much more
than half a century. Zinc is a brilliant white
metal, inclining to blue, Its specific gravity
is from 6.9 to 7.2. It was till lately considered
as a brittle metal; but Messrs. Hobson and
Sylvester, of Sheffield, have discovered that
between the temperature of 210° and 300°,
zinc yields to the hammer, may be laminated,
wire drawn, &c. and that after being thus
wrought, it continues soft and flexible. It
melts about 680°, and above that temperature
evaporates considerably. Zinc soon loses its
lustre in the air, and grows grey; but in wa-
ter it becomes black, and hydrogen gas is
emitted. Zinc combines with oxygen; and
either it or its oxides combine with sulphur
and phosphorus. It forms alloys with most of
the metals, some of which are very useful.

The atom of zinc weighs nearly 56 times as
much as hydrogen,

Porasivm, We are principally indebted to

POTASIUM. 261

Mr. Davy for our knowledge of this metal ; its
oxide, potash, or the fixed vegetable alkali,
is universally known; but the decomposition
of the oxide is a recent discovery. To obtain
the metal, a small piece (30 or 40 grains) of
pure caustic potash, which has been exposed
to the air a few moments, to acquire a slight
degree of moisture, sufficient to render ita
conductor of galvanism, is to be exposed to
the action of a powerful galvanic battery ; by
its operation, the oxygen of the potash is ex-
pelled, and fluid metallic globules of the ap-
pearance of mercury, are obtained. This
metal has also been produced by Messrs. Gay
Lussac and Thenard, by exposing potash to
iron turnings in a white heat : some potasium
was obtained, and an alloy of potasium and
iron. Mr. Davy has made an experiment
with a similar result; and found that a large
quantity of hydrogen gas is at the same time
given out. ‘This fact seems to point out pot-
ash as a compound of potasium and water,
and not of potasium and oxygen ; the French
chemists argue that potasium is a compound of
hydrogen and potash ; but, as Mr. Davy pro-
perly observes, their argument amounts to this,
that potasium is a compound of hydrogen and
an unknown base, which compound united to
oxygen forms potash. This subject must be

--- Page 290 ---
262 SODIUM,

left to future experience.—Potasium, at the
temperature of $2°, is solid and brittle ; and
its fragments exhibit a crystallized texture : at
50°, it is soft and malleable ; at 60°, it is im-
perfectly fluid; at 100%, it is perfectly fluid,
and small globules unite as in mercury. It
may be distilled by a heat approaching to red-
ness. Irs specific gravity is only 6 ; this cir-
cumstance would seem to countenance the
notion of its containing hydrogen. Potasium
combines with oxygen, sulphur, and phos-
phorus ; and it seems tu form alloys with many
of the metals.

The weight of an atom of potasium appears
from its combination with oxygen to be 35
times that of hydrogen.

Soptum. Mr. Davy obtained this metal
from the fixed mineral alkali, or soda, by
means of galyanism, in the same way as pota-
sium. Sodium, at the common temperature,
isa solid, white metal, having the appearance
of silver; it is exceedingly malleable, and
much softer than other metallic substances.
Its specific gravity is rather less than water,
being 9348. It begins to melt at 120°, and
is perfectly fluid at 180°. It combines with
oxygen, sulphur, and phosphorus ; and forms
alloys with the metals.

The weight of an atom of sodium, as de-

--- Page 291 ---
BISMUTH. ANTIMONY. 263

duced from its combination with oxygen, is
nearly 21 times the weight of hydrogen.

Bismuty. This has not been known as a
distinct metal much more than a century. Its
ores are found chiefly in Germany.—Bismuth
is of a reddish white colour ; it loses its lustre
by exposure to the air ; its specific gravity is
about 9.8; it is hard, but breaks with a smart
stroke of a hammer ; it melts about 480°. In
a strong red heat, bismuth burns with a blue
flame, and emits yellow fumes. It combines
with oxygen and sulphur, and forms alloys
with most of the metals.

The weight of an atom of bismuth, may be
derived from its oxides and sulphuret : it seems
to be about 68 times the weight of an atom of
hydrogen.

Antimony. Some of the ores of this metal
were known to the ancients; but the metal in.
a pure state, has not been known more than
300 years. Antimony has a greyish white
colour, and considerable brilliancy ; its spe-
cific gravity is 6.7 or 6.8 ; it is very brittle ; it
melts about 810° Fahrenheit ; it loses its lustre
in time by exposure to the air. Antimony
combines with oxygen, sulphur, and phos-
phorus; and it forms alloys with most of the
other metals.

The weight of an atom of antimony, is

--- Page 292 ---
264 ARSENIC, COBALT.

determinable from its compounds with oxygen
and sulphur, and seems to be 40 times the
weight of hydrogen.

Arsentc. Certain compounds of Arsenic
were known to the ancients. It seems to
have been known in a distinct character for
more than a century. Arsenic has a blueish
grey colour, and considerable brilliancy, which
it soon loses by exposure to the air; its specific
gravity is stated to be 8.5; its fusing point has
not been ascertained, by reason of its great
volatility: it has been heated to 350°, at which
temperature it sublimes quickly, and exhibits
a strong smell resembling that of gariic, which
is characteristic of this metal. It combines
with oxygen, forming one of the most virulent
poisons ; also with hydrogen, sulphur, and
phosphorus ; and it forms alloys with most of
the metals.

The weight of an atom of arsenic, appears
from its compounds to be 42 times that of
hydrogen.

Cozatt. The ore of this metal has been
long used to tinge glass blue; but it was not
till the last century that a peculiar metal was
extracted from it. Cobalt is of a grey colour,
inclining to red; it has not much lustre : its
specific gravity is about 7.8; it is brittle; it
melts at 180° of Wedgwood ; it is attracted

--- Page 293 ---
MANGANESE. 265

by the magnet, and is itself capable of being
made magnetic, according to Wenzel. Co-
balt combines with oxygen, sulphur, and phos-
phorus; and it forms alloys with most of the
metals, but they are of little importance.

The weight of an atom of cobalt cannot be
accurately obtained from the data we have at
present ; it is probably 50 or 60 times that of
hydrogen.

MancaneszE. The dark brown mineral
called manganese, has been known and used
in the glass manufactories, perhaps more than
acentury: but the meral which now goes by
the same name, was not discovered till about
40 years ago: in fact, it is not yet much
known, being obtained with difficulty, and by
a great heat. The metal is of a greyish white
colour, and considerable brilliancy : its specific
gravity is 6.85 or 7 ; it is brittle, and melts at
160° of Wedgwood ; when reduced to powder,
it is attracted by the magnet, which is sup-
posed to be owing to the presence of iron.
Manganese attracts oxygen from the air, be-
coming grey, brown, and finally black. It is
capable of being combined with sulphur and
phosphorus ; and it forms alloys with some of
the metals, but they have not been much ex-
amined.

The weight of an atom of manganese, as

determined from its oxides, seems to be about
40 times that of hydrogen.

Curomium. ‘his metal, united to oxygen
go as to constitute an acid, is found in the red
lead ore of Siberia, The pure metal being
obtained, is white inclining to yellow ; it is
brittle, and requires a great heat to fuse it. It
combines with oxygen. The other properties
of this metal are not yet known. Its atom,
perhaps, weighs about 12 times that of hy-
drogen.

Uranium. This metal was discovered by
Klaproth, in 1789, in a mineral found in Sax-
ony. It is obtained with some difficulty, and
only in small quantities ; it has, therefore,
been examined but by few. The colour of
uranium is iron grey; it has considerable
lustre ; it yields to the file ; its specific gravity
is 8.1, according to Klaproth ; 9.0, according
to Bucholz. Uranium unites with oxygen, and
probably with sulphur: its alloys have not been
ascertained.

The weight of an atom of this metal, is pro-
bably about 60 times that of hydrogen.

Mo.yspenum. The ore from which this
metal is obtained is a sulphuret, called molyb-
dena ; but it requires an extraordinary heat to
reduce it; the metal has not hitherto been
obtained, except in small grains. It is of a

--- Page 295 ---
TUNGSTEN. TITANIUM. 267

yellowish white colour ; its specific gravity is
7.4, according to Hielm; but 8.6, according
to Bucholz. It combines with oxygen, sul-
phur, and phosphorus ; and it forms alloys
with several of the metals.

The atom of molybdenum, probably weighs
about 60 times that of hydrogen.

Tuncsten. This metal is one of those recently
discovered. It is difficultly obtained, requiring
an excessive heat for its fusion. It is of a
greyish white colour, and considerable bril-
liancy ; its specific gravity is 17.2 or 17.6; it is
very hard, being scarcely impressed with a file,
It combines with oxygen, sulphur, and phos-
phorus ; and it forms alloys with other metals.

We have not sufficient data, from which to
determine the weight of an atom of tungsten :
as far as we can judge from its oxides, its
weight must be 55 times that of hydrogen, or
upwards.

Titanium. This metal has been lately dis-
covered. It is said to be of a dark copper
colour ; it has much brilliancy, is brittle, and
possesses in small scales a considerable degree
of elasticity. It is highly infusible. It tar-
nishes on exposure to the air; is oxidized by
heat, and then becomes blueish. It unites
with phosphorus, and has been alloyed with
iron. It detonates when thrown into red hot

nitre. The atom of titanium probably weighs
about 40 or 50 times that of hydrogen.

Corvmsium. In 1802, Mr. Hatchett dis-
covered a new metallic acid in an ore con-
taining iron, from America. We did not
succeed in reducing the acid to a metal ; but,
from the phenomena it exhibited, there was
little room to doubt of its containing a peculiar
metal, which he called columbium.

Tanratium, This metal has lately been
discovered by M. Ekeberg, a Swedish che-
mist. A white powder is extracted from
certain minerals. which appears to be an oxide
of this metal. When this white oxide is
strongly heated along with charcoal, in a cru-
cible, a metallic button is formed, of external
lustre, but black and void of lustre within. The
acids again convert it into the state of a white
oxide, which does not alter its colour when
heated to redness.

Cerium. The oxide of this metal is ob-
tained from a Swedish mineral. No one has
yet succeeded completely in reducing this ox-
ide ; so that the properties of the metal, and
even its existence, are yet unknown. But the
earth or supposed oxide, is found to have pro-
perties similar to those of other oxides. These,
of course, belong to a future article, the me-
tallic oxides.

COMPOUNDS OF TWO ELEMENTS.

Iv order to understand what is intended to
be signified by bénary and ternary compounds,
&c. the reader is referred to page 213 and seq.
Some persons are used to denominate all com-
pounds, where only two elements can be dis-
covered, binary compounds ; such, for in-
stance, as nitrous gas, nitrous oxide, nitric
acid, &c. in all of which we find ouly azote
and oxygen. But it is more consistent with
our views to restrict the term binary, to signify
two atoms ; fernary, to signify three atoms,
&c. whether those atoms be elementary or
otherwise ; that is, whether they are the atoms
of undecompounded bodies, as hydrogen and
oxygen, or the atoms of compound bodies, as
water and ammonia.

In each of the following sections, we shall
consider the compounds of some two of the
elementary or undecompounded bodies ; be-
ginning each section with the binary com-
pounds, then proceeding to the ¢ernary com-

--- Page 298 ---
270 OXYGEN WITH HYDROGEN.

pounds, or at least to those which consist of
three atoms, though they may be binary in the
sense we use the term; and so on to the more
complex forms.

This chapter will comprehend all the aeri-
form bodies that have not been considered in
the last, several of the acids, the alkalies, the
earths, and the metallic oxides, sulphurets,
carburets, and phosphurets.

In treating of these articles, I intend to
adopt the most common names for them ; but
it will be obvious, that if the doctrine herein
contained be established, a renovation of the
chemical nomenclature will in some cases be
expedient.

SECTION 1.

OXYGEN WITH HYDROGEN.

1. Water.

This liquid, the most useful and abundant
of any in nature, is now well known both by
analytic and synthetic methods, to be a com-
pound of the two elements, oxygen and hy-
drogen.

Canton has proved that water is in degree
compressible. The expansive effect of heat

--- Page 299 ---
WATER. 271

on water has been already pointed out. The
weight of a cubic foot of water is very near
1000 ounces avoirdupoise. This fluid is com-
monly taken as the standard for comparing the
specific gravities of bodies, its weight being
denoted by unity.

Distilled water is the purest ; next to that,
rain water; then river water; and, lastly,
spring water. By purity in this place, is
meant freedom from any foreign body in a
state of solution ; but in regard to transpa-
rency, and an agreeable taste, spring water
generally excels the others. Pure water has
the quality we call soft; spring and other im-
pure water has the quality we call hard.
Every one knows the great difference of wa-
ters in these respects ; yet it is seldom that the
hardest spring water contains so much as zz'sgth
part of its weight of any foreign body in solu-
tion. The substances held in solution are usu-
ally carbonate and sulphate of lime.

Water usually contains about 2 per cent. of
its bulk of common air, This air is originally
forced into it by the pressure of the atmo-
sphere ; and can be expelled again no other
way than by removing that pressure. This
may be done by an air-pump; or it may in
great part be effected by subjecting the water
to ebullition, in which case steam takes the

--- Page 300 ---
272 OXYGEN WITH HYDROGEN.

place of the incumbent air, and its pressure is
found inadequate to restrain the dilatation of
the airin the water, which of course makes its
escape. But it is difficult to expel all the air
by either of those operations. Air expelled
from common spring water, after losing 5 or 10
per cent. of carbonic acid, consists of 38 per
cent. of oxygen and 62 of azote.

Water is distinguished for entering into
combination with other bodies. To some it
unites in a small definite proportion, consti-
tuting a solid compound. This is the case in
its combination with the fixed alkalies, lime,
and with a great number of salts ; the com-
pounds are either dry powders or crystals,
Such compounds have received the name of
hydrates. But when the water is in excess, a
different sort of combination seems to take
place, which is called solution. In this case,
the compound is /iguid and transparent ; as
when common salt or sugar are dissolved in
water. When any body is thus dissolved in
water, it may be uniformly diffused through
any larger quantity of that liquid, and seems to
continue so, without manifesting any tendency
to subside, as far as is known.

In 1781, the composition and decomposition
of water were ascertained; the former by
Watt and Cavendish, and the latter by Lavoi-

--- Page 301 ---
WATER. 273

sier and Meusnier. The first experiment on
the composition of water on a large scale,
was made by Monge, in 1783 ; he procured
about 31b. of water, by the combustion of
hydrogen gas, and noted the quantities of hy-
drogen and oxygen gas which had disappeared.
The second experiment was made by Le
Feyre de Gineau, in 1788; he obtained about

Ibs. of water in the same way. The third
was made by Fourcroy, Vauquelin, and Se-
guin, in 1790, in which more than a pound
of water was obtained. The general result
was, that 85 parts by weight of oxygen unite
to 15 of hydrogen to form 100 parts of water.
—Experiments to ascertain the proportion of
the elements arising from the decomposition
of water, were made by Le Fevre de Gineau
and by Lavoisier, by transmitting steam
through a red hot tube containing a quantity
of soft iron wire ; the oxygen of the water
combined with the iron, and the hydrogen
was collected in gas. The same proportion,
or 85 parts of oxygen and 15 of hydrogen, were
found as in the composition.

The Dutch chemists, Dieman and Troostwyk,
first succeeded in decomposing water by elec-
tricity, in 1789. he effect is now produced
readily by galvanism. The composition of
water is easily and elegantly shewn, by means

--- Page 302 ---
274 OXYGEN WITH HYDROGEN.

of Volta’s cudiometer, an instrument of the
greatest importance in researches concerning
elastic fluids. It consists of a strong gra-
duated glass tube, into which a wire is her-
metically sealed,’ or strongly cemented ; ano-
ther detached wire is pushed up the tube,
nearly to meet the former, so that an electric
spark or shock can be sent from one wire to
the other through any portion of gas, or mix-
ture of gases, confined by water or mercury.
The end of the tube being immersed in a
liquid, when an explosion takes place, no
“communication with the external air can arise ;
so that the change produced is capable of being
ascertained.

The component parts of water being clearly
established, it becomes of importance to de-
termine with as much precision as possible,
the relative weights of the two elements con-
stituting that liquid. The mean results of
analysis and synthesis, have given 85 parts of
oxygen and 15 of hydrogen, which are gene-
rally adopted. In this estimate, I think, the
quantity of hydrogen is overrated. There is
an excellent memoir in the 53d vol. of the
Annal. de Chémie, 1805, by Humboltd and
Gay-Lussac, on the proportion of oxygen and
hydrogen in water, They make it appear,
that the quantity of aqueous vapour which

--- Page 303 ---
WATER. 275

elastic fluids usually contain, will so far influ-
ence the weight of hydrogen gas, as to change
the more accurate result of Fourcroy, &c. of
85.7 oxygen and 14.3 hydrogen, to 87.4 oxy-
gen and 12.6 hydrogen. Their reasoning ap-
pears to me perfectly satisfactory. The re-
lation of these two numbers is that of 7 to 1
nearly, There is another consideration which
seems to put this matter beyond doubt. In
Volta’s eudiometer, fwo measures of hydrogen
require just one of oxygen to saturate them.
Now, the accurate experiments of Cavendish
and Lavoisier, have shewn that oxygen is
nearly 14 times the weight of hydrogen ; the
exact coincidence of this with the conclusion
above deduced, is a sufficient confirmation.—
If, however, any one chooses to adopt the
common estimate of 85 to 15, then the re-
lation of oxygen to hydrogen will be as 53. to
1; this would require the weight of oxy-
genous gas to be only 114 times the weight of
hydrogen.

The absolute weights of oxygen and hy-
drogen in water being determined, the relative
weights of their atoms may be investigated.
As only one compound of oxygen and hy-
drogen is certainly known, it is agrecable to
the Ist rule, page 214, that water should be
concluded a binary compound, ; or, one atom

--- Page 304 ---
276 OXYGEN WITH HYDROGEN.

of oxygen unites with one of hydrogen to form
one of water. Hence, the relative weights of
the atoms of oxygen and hydrogen are 7 to 1.

The above conclusion is strongly corrobo-
rated by other considerations. Whatever may
be the proportions in which oxygen and hy-
drogen are mixed, whether 20 measures of
oxygen to 2 of hydrogen, or 20 of hydrogen
to 2 of oxygen, still when an electric spark is
passed, water is formed by the union of 2 mea-
sures of hydrogen with 1 of oxygen, and the
surplus gas is unchanged. Again, when wa-
ter is decomposed by electricity, or by other
agents, no other clements than oxygen and hy-
drogen are obtained. Besides, all the other
compounds into which those two elements
enter, will in the sequel be found to support
the same conclusion.

After all, it must be allowed to be possible
that water may be a ternary compound. In
this case, if two atoms of hydrogen unite to
one of oxygen, then an atom of oxygen must
weigh 14 times as much as one of hydrogen ;
if two atoms of oxygen unite to one of hydro-
gen, then an atom of oxygen must weigh 3}
times one of hydrogen.

FLUORIC ACID. 277

2, Fluoric Acid.

The acid obtained from the fluor spar, which
abounds in Derbyshire, is one of those the base
of which has not yet been clearly ascertained ;
but, guided partly by theoretic reasoning, and
partly by experience, I have ventured to place
it among the compounds of hydrogen with
oxygen, and to rank it next to water in sim-
plicity of constitution ; it is, as I conceive, a
compound of two atoms of oxygen with one
of hydrogen.

Scheele and Priestley have distinguished
themselves in investigating the properties of
this acid ; and Dr. Henry and Mr. Davy have
attempted to decompose it. The acid may be
obtained by taking a quantity of pounded fluor
spar (fluate of lime), putting it into a gas bottle
with about the same weight of sulphuric acid
undiluted, and then applying a leat, so as to
raise the temperature to about the boiling heat
of water. ‘The acid is produced in the gaseous
form, and must be received over mercury ; but
if it is intended to condense it in water, then
the gas, as it is generated, may be sent into a
receiver containing some water at the bottom ;
the water will rapidly absorb the gas, end in-
crease in density.

--- Page 306 ---
278 OXYGEN WITH HYDROGEN.

Some of the: properties of this acid are, 1. In
the elastic state it is destructive of combustion,
and of animal life; it has a pungent smell,
somewhat like muriatic acid, and not less suf-
focating ; its specific gravity has not been ac-
curately obtained ; but from some experiments
Lhave made, it seems to be extremely heavy
when obtained in glass vessels ; in fact, it is in
that case a superfluate of silica: Into a clean
dry flask, I sent a quantity of fluoric acid gas ;
after some time, the mixture of common air
and acid was corked, and the flask weighed :
it had acquired 12 grains. The flask was next
inverted in water, to see how much would be
absorbed, and that quantity was taken for the
acid gas. The capacity of the flask was 26
cubic inches, containing originally 8.2 grains
of common air; 12 cubic inches of acid gas
had entered. According to this, if the whole
flask had been filled with the gas, it would
have gained 26 grains ; consequently, 26 cubic
inches of the acid gas would weigh 34.2
grains, and its specific gravity be 4.17 times
that of common air. This experiment was
repeated with a proportional result. The flask
became partially lined with a thin, dry film
of fluate of silica during the operation, which
no doubt contributed something to the weight ;
but I am convinced, from other experiments,

--- Page 307 ---
FLUORIC ACID. 279

that this gas, when loaden with silica, is hea-
vier than most others. A tube, four tenths of
an inch in diameter, and 10 inches long, being
filled with this acid gas, and inverted for one
minute, retained only .3,ths of the gas;
whereas, with carbonic acid gas, it retained
4¢ths ; and with oxymuriatic acid gas, ,°ths.
2. Water absorbs a very large portion of this
gas ; but the quantity is, like as in other si-
milar cases, regulated by the temperature and
pressure conjointly : at the common tempe-
rature and pressure, I have observed 2 grains
of water take up 200 times their bulk of the
gas, and leave little residuum besides common
air. It is seldom obtained in large quantities
of this strength ; when water has imbibed its
bulk of the gas, it has a sour taste, and all the
other characters of acids. 3. The property of
dissolving silica (flint) is peculiar to this acid ;
when it is obtained, as usual, in glass vessels,
it corrodes the glass, and takes up a portion of
silica, which is held in solution in the trans-
parent gas; but as soon as this comes in con-
tact with water, the silica is deposited in form
of a white crust, namely, fluate of silica, on
the surface of the water. 4. The gas, when
thrown into common air, exhibits white fumes
(like muriatic acid) ; this is owing to its com-
bining with the steam or aqueous vapour,

--- Page 308 ---
230 OXYGEN WITH HYDROGEN,

which common air always contains in a dif-
fused state. "5. Fluoric acid combines with
the alkalies, earths, and metallic oxides, form-
ing salts denominated fluates.

The weight of an atom of fluoric acid may
be investigated from the salts into which it
enters as an integral element. Of these, the
fluate of lime is most abundant, and best
known. Scheele is said to have faund 57 parts of
lime, and 43 of acid and water, in fluate of lime.
Richter finds 65 lime, and 35 acid in this salt.
These are the only authorities I know : they
differ materially. In order to satisfy myself, 1
took 50 grains of finely pulverized spar, and
having mixed with it as much, or more, strong
sulphuric acid, the whole was exposed to a
heat gradually increasing to redness; the re-
sult was, a hard dry crust of mixed sulphate
and fluate of lime ; this was pulverized, then
weighed, and again mixed with sulphuric
acid, and heated as before ; this process was
repeated two or three times, or as long as any
increase of weight was found. At last, a dry
white powder, of 75 grains, was obtained,
which was pure sulphate of lime. “This expe-
riment, two or three times repeated, gave al-
ways 75 grains finally. ence, 50 grains of
fluate of lime contain just as much lime as 75.

will be found in the sequel to represent the
weight of an atom of lime; therefore, 15 re-
presents the weight of an atom of fluoric acid,
it being assumed that fluate of lime is consti-
tuted of one atom of acid united to one atom
of lime.

Before we commence the analytical investi-
gation of this acid, it will be proper to discuss
its relation to steam or aqueous vapour, which
appears at present to be much misunderstood ;
the observations equally apply to muriatic acid
gas, and to some others, which will be no-
ticed in their places. It is universally known,
that common air over water contains a quantity
of steam or vapour, some way or other com-
bined or mixed with it, which does not im-
pair its transparency, but which gives it th
of its elastic force, at the temperature of 65° ;
the vapour too, increases and diminishes in
force and quantity in same ratio with the tem-
perature. Clement and Desormes have shewn,

--- Page 310 ---
232 OXYGEN WITH HYDROGEN.

that this vapour is the same in quantity for at-
mospheric air, oxygen, hydrogen, azote, and
carbonic acid, and probably for most other
gases. This vapour can be abstracted from the
gases by any body possessing an attraction for
water ; such as sulphuric acid, lime, &c. In
short, it can be taken out, as far as is known,
by any body that will take out pure steam.
Some authors consider the vapour united to
the air by a slight affinity ; others call it hy-
grometrical affinity, &c. My opinion on this
subject has already been stated, that the steam
mixed with air differs in no respect from pure
steam ; and, consequently, is subject to the
same laws. There are some elastic fluids,
however, which have so strong an affinity for
water, that they will not permit this steam
quietly to associate with them ; these are fluo-
ric, muriatic, sulphuric, and nitric acids. No
sooner are these acid gases presented to any
air containing steam, but they seize upon the
steam ; the two united, are converted into a
liquid ; visible fumes appear, which after play-
ing about a while, are observed to fall down,
or adhere to the sides of the vessel, till the gas
no longer finding any steam present, occupies
the volume of the vessel in a transparent state,
free from every atom of vapour. ‘These acid
gases cannot exist one moment along with

--- Page 311 ---
FLUORIC ACID. 283

steam ; they are no longer elastic fluids, but
liquids ; the drops of liquid float about, and
cause the visibility, till, like rain, they sub-
side ; they are not reabsorbed ; for, if the sur-
face of a glass vessel is once moistened with
them, it remains so. Hence, it should seem
that these acid gases, so far from obstinately
retaining their vapour, as is commonly ima-
gined, they cannot be induced to admit any
vapour at all, in ordinary circumstances. This
being clearly understood, we can now proceed
to consider the experiments on the analysis of
fluoric acid.

In the Philos. Transact. for 1800, Dr. Henry
has given us an interesting set of experiments
on the decomposition of the muriatic acid by
electricity : at the conclusion, he observes on
fluoric acid—‘ When electrified alone, in a
“ glass tube, coated internally with wax, it
“sustained a diminution of bulk, and there
“remained a portion of hydrogenous gas.”
Now, admitting the accuracy of the fact, it
seems fair to infer, that hydrogen is a consti-
tuent principle of fluoric acid ; and not, as he
supposed, derived from the water it contains.
More recently, Mr. Davy has ascertained, (see
Philos. Transact. for 1808) that potasium burns
in fluoric acid, and the result is fluate of pot-
ash. and a little hydrogen gas is liberated. In

--- Page 312 ---
284 OXYGEN WITH HYDROGEN.

particular, 104 grains of potasium were burned
in 19 cubic inches of fluoric acid, 14 of which
disappeared, fluate of potash was formed, and
2: cubic inches of hydrogen were evolved.
Here it is evident, that both oxygen and hy-
drogen were found in the fluoric acid, and
must have made an integral part of that acid,
as no vapour could subsist in it ; whence it
appears, that both oxygen and hydrogen are
essential to fluoric acid. Moreover, it is highly
probable that the pure acid in the 14 inches of
gas, weighed about 6 grains, (common air be-
ing 44) and the oxygen necessary for 103 po-
tasium, would be 2 grains; whence the acid
entering into composition, would be about
twice the weight of the oxygen united to the
potasium.

I shall now relate some of my own expe-
riments on the decomposition of this acid.

1. Fluoric acid gas may, I find, be kept in
glass tubes for several hours or days, without
any change of bulk ; it continues at the end
absorbable by water as at first. Two suc-
cessive trials were made, by clectrifying about
30 water grain measures of the gas. After
two hours electrification, no change of volume
was produced. Water was then admitted,
which absorbed «l] but + grain measures ; to
this 1-+ measures of hydrogen were added, and

--- Page 313 ---
FLUORIC ACID. 285

a sufficient quantity of oxygen ; the whole
was then exploded, anda diminution of 23.3
was observed, denoting 15,5 hydrogen. Here
seems, then, to have been a decomposition of
the acid, and a formation of 1.5 hydrogen.
This was the result of the latter experiment,
and the former was to the same effect.

2. Fluoric acid gas, electrified along with
hydrogen, experiences a diminution, but this
is much greater in the hydrogen than in the
acid. The result of one of the most careful
experiments follows. A mixture of 20 mea-
sures of fluoric acid, and 33 of hydrogen, was
electrified for three hours uninterruptedly, by
a dense stream of sparks; it diminished from
33 to 19; of the loss, 10 was found to be hy-
drogen, and 4 acid.—Here the hydrogen must,
probably, have formed water with part of the
oxygen of the acid.

8. Fluoric acid was mixed with oxygen,
and electrified one hour; a small diminution
was observed, and the surface of the mercury
was tarnished.

4. Fluoric acid gas was mixed with oxymu-
riatic acid gas: no sensible change was pro-
duced.

Upon the whole, it appears that the weight
of an atom of fluotic acid is about 15 times
that of hydrogen, that it contains hydrogen

--- Page 314 ---
286 OXYGEN WITH HYDROGEN,

and oxygen, and nothing besides as far as is
certainly known. Now, as the weight of one
atom of hydrogen, and two of oxygen, just
make 15 times that of hydrogen, there is great
reason to presume that this must be the con-
stitution of that acid. Besides, analogy is
strongly in favour of the conclusion; an atom
of the other elementary principles, azote, car-
bone, sulphur, and phosphorus, joined to two
atoms of oxygen, each forms a peculiar acid,
as will be shewn in the sequel ; why, then,
should not one atom of hydrogen and two of
oxygen, also form an acid?

8. Muriatic Acid.

To obtain muriatic acid in the elastic state,
a portion of common salt, muriate of soda, is
put into a gas bottle, and about an equal
weight of concentrated sulphuric acid ; by the
application of a moderate heat to the mixture,
a gas comes over, which may be exhibited over
mercury ; it is muriatic acid gas,

Some of the properties of muriatic acid gas,
are: 1. It is an invisible elastic fluid, having
a pungent smell ; it is unfit for respiration, or
for the support of combustion ; when mixed
with common air, it produces a white cloud,

--- Page 315 ---
MURIATIC ACID. 287

which is owing to its combination with steam,
and the consequent formation of innumerable
small drops of liquid muriatic acid. 2. Its
specific gravity appears to be about 1.61 times
that of common air, from some experiments of
mine ; but, according to Brisson, it is 1.43 ; and
according.to Kirwan, 1.93 at the temperature
of 60°, and pressure of 30 inches of mercury.
There are two sources of error obvious in de-
termining its specific gravity ; the one is, that
liquid muriatic acid is apt to insinuate itself,
if the utmost attention is not paid to have the
mercury in the vessel dry, in which case the
weight is found too great ; this is probably
Kirwan’s error: the other is, a quantity of
common air may be mixed with the acid gas,
in which case its weight will be too little.
In order to find the specific gravity of this gas,
adopted the same method as with fluoric acid
(see page 278). A flask containing 8.2 grains
of common air, when partially filled with mu-
riatic acid gas, (namely 3iths) acquired just $
grains ; and a like proportion in several other
trials ; from which I find the specific gravity
given above. 3. It possesses the characterisic
properties of acids; namely, that of converting
vegetable blues to red, of uniting with al-
Kalies, &c. 4. It is rapidly and largely ab-
sorbed by water, which takes up between four

--- Page 316 ---
288 OXYGEN WITH HYDROGEN,

and five hundred times its bulk of the gas, at
the common temperature and pressure ; that
is, rather less than an cqual weight. This
combination of water and muriatic acid gas,
constitutes the common liquid muriatic acid,
or spirit of salt of commerce ; but it is never
of the strength indicated above. It is usually
of a yellow colour, owing to some atoms of iron
which it holds in solution.

The constitution of this acid, is a question
that has long engaged the attention of chemists.
Thisacid seemsmore difficultly decomposed than
most others. Electricity, so powerful an agent
in the composition and decomposition of other
acids, seems to fail in this. Inthe Phil. Tr. for
1800, Dr. Henry has given us the results of a
laborious investigation on this subject. From
these it appears that pure, dry muriatic acid
gas, is scarcely affected by electricity. A very
small diminution in volume, and some traces
of hydrogenous gas, were observed, which he
ascribes to the water or steam which the gas
contains. But we have already remarked,
(page 283) that muriatic acid gas naturally
contains no steam ; or, if it contains any, it
must be much less than other gases contain.
It is probable, therefore, that the hydrogen
was derived from the decomposition of part of
the acid. This conclusion is strengthened by

--- Page 317 ---
MURIATIC ACID. 289

the recent experiments of Mr. Davy, in which
the acid has apparently undergone a complete
decomposition. In his Electrochemical Re-
searches, in the Philos. Transact. for 1808, he
observes—‘ When potasium was heated in mu-
* riatic acid gas, as dry as it could be obtained
‘by common chemical means, there was a
«violent chemical action with ignition ; and
“when the potasium was in sufficient quan-
‘tity, the muriatic acid gas wholly disap-
‘peared, and from one third to one fourth of
‘its volume of hydrogene was evolved, and
‘muriate of potash was formed.’ Here it is
almost certain a portion of the acid was de-
composed ; the residuary hydrogen, and the
oxygen required to convert the potasium into
potash, are the only ostensible elements of the
acid ; hence we must infer, that muriatic acid
is a compound of oxygen and hydrogen. In
a subsequent paper in the same volume, Mr.
Davy informs us, that 8 grains of potasium took
22 cubic inches of acid gas, and gave 8 inches
of hydrogen. This particular experiment must,
however, be incorrect in some point; or other-
wise the general observation before made ;
because they are inconsistent with each other.
For, 22 cubic inches of acid gas weigh 11
grains, to which adding 8 grains of potasium,
we obtain 19 grains ; but 8 grains of potasiunr

--- Page 318 ---
290 OXYGEN WITH HYDROGEN.”

form only 14.6 grains of muriate of potash, to
which adding .2 grain for the 8 cubic inches
of hydrogen, gives 14.8 instead of 19 grains.
I would therefore adopt the general fact,
which was confirmed by several experiments,
and is entirely consistent ; namely, that when
potasium in sufficient quantity is burned in mu-
riatic acid gas, the whole of the gas disap-
pears, and from one third to one fourth of its
volume of hydrogen is evolved, and muriate of
potash formed. ‘Vhis is one of the most im-
portant facts that has been ascertained, re-
specting the constitution of muriatic acid.
Now, the clements of muriate of potash are
as follow : $5 grains of potasium +7 of oxy-
gen = 42 of potash ; and 42 potash + 22 mu-
riatic acid = Gt grains of muriate of potash.
From this it appears, that the oxygen in mu-
riate of potash is nearly 4 of the weight of the
acid. According to this, when potasium is
burned in muriatic acid gas, nearly } of the
whole weight (for the hydrogen weighs little)
goes to the oxidizement of the potasium, and
the remaining 3 unite with the potash formed.
JIence, when 22 cubic inches, or 11 grains
of gas disappear, as in the particular experi-
ment lately mentioned, 23 grains nearly must
have been oxygen derived from the acid, and
8s grains of acid joined to the potash so

--- Page 319 ---
MURIATIC ACID. 291

formed. But 23 grains of oxygen = 8 cubic
inches, would require 16 inches of hydrogen
to form water : it is evident, then, that water
was not the source of the oxygen; for, if it
had, there must have been twice the quantity
of hydrogen evolved. Mr. Davy has ascer-
tained another fact, exactly similar to the ge-
neral one just stated; namely, that when char-
coal is galvanized in muriatic acid gas, mu-
riate of mercury is formed, and hydrogen,
amounting to + of the volume of the gas is
evolved. He infers from this, that water is
present to form oxide enough to saturate the
acid ; but, setting aside the inference I have
drawn, that no water can be present with
muriatic acid gas, the oxygen required to form
the oxide in this case as well as the former,
if derived from water, would evolve at least
twice as much hydrogen. For, the relation of
the oxygen in the oxide to the acid in the
muriate, is proved by the fact, to be the same
in the two cases.

Mr. Davy has, indeed, endeavoured to ob-
viate any objection that may be made, as to
the source of the oxygen in these experiments ;
he has found that nearly the same weight of
muriate of mercury is formed, by precipi-
tating a mercurial solution by a given volume
of muriatic acid gas, as by burning potasium

--- Page 320 ---
292 OXYGEN WITH HYDROGEN.

in the same quantity of gas, and then trans-
ferring the acid to mercury: he observes,
* there was no notable difference in the results.”
The inference must, I conceive, be erroneous;
100 cubic inches of muriatic acid gas, united
to potash, must give more muriate of potash,
than if potasium was burned in the same gas ;
the weights of the materials necessarily require
it; unless it be found that the two muriates are
not the same salt.

From all the muriates, or salts, into which
the muriatic acid enters, it appears (as will be
shewn when these salts are considered) that the
weight of an atom of muriatic acid is 22 times
that of hydrogen. Very soon after this deter-
mination, it occurred to me that hydrogen was
probably the base of the acid ; if so, an atom
of the acid must consist of 1 atom of hydrogen
and $ atoms of oxygen, as the weights of these
just make up 22, In 1807 this idea was an-
nounced, and a suitable figurative represen-
tation of the atom was given, in the Chemical
Lectures at Edinburgh and Glasgow ; but this
constitution of the acid was hypothetical, till
these experiments of Mr. Davy seem to put it
past doubt. The application of the theory to
the experiments is as follows: on the suppo-
sition that the specific gravity of muriatic acid
gas is 1.67, it will be found that 12 measures

--- Page 321 ---
MURIATIC ACID. 293

of the acid contain 11 ineasures of hydrogen,
if liberated, and about 16% measures of oxy-
gen; then if 1th of the acid be decomposed,
nearly 3 measures of hydrogen will be libe-
rated, and 44 measures of oxygen, and the
atoms of this oxygen will apply, 1 to 1, tothe
atoms of potasium, and furnish potash for the
remaining 3ths of the acid, (because 1 atom of
acid contains 3 of oxygen). The very same
explanation will apply to the formation of mu-
riate of mercury. Here the hydrogen will be
rather less than ith of the volume of the acid
gas; but if we adopt Kirwan’s specific gravity
of muriatic acid, 1.93, then the hydrogen
evolved will be between 4 and 3th of the vo-
lume of acid gas.

Hence we conclude that an atom of muriatic
acid gas consists of 1 atom of hydrogen and 3
of oxygen, or 1 atom of water and 2 of oxy-
gen, and its weight = 22. Moreover, the dia-
meter of the acid atom will be found (page 226)
= 1.07, that of hydrogen being 1; or 12 mea-
sures of acid contain as many atoms as 11 mea-
sures of hydrogen, or as 5; of oxygen.

My own experiments on muriatic acid gas
have not been productive of important results.
TI sent 1000 small shocks of electricity through
30 measures of gas ; there was a diminution of

--- Page 322 ---
294 OXYGEN WITH HYDROGEN.

1 measure, and on letting up water the whole
was absorbed, except one measure, which
appeared to be hydrogen. I sent 700 shocks
through a mixture of muriatic acid gas and
hydrogen ; there was no change. A mixture
of muriatic acid gas and sulphuretted hydrogen
being electrified, hydrogen was evolved, and
sulphur deposited, but no change of volume.
It was evident the sulphuretted hydrogen only
was decomposed. Whena mixture of oxygen
and hydrogen is fired along with muriatic acid
gas, water is formed, and it instantly absorbs
nearly its weight of acid gas. From these and
such like unsuccessful attempts to decompose
the muriatic acid, the importance of Mr. Davy’s
experiments is manifest.

The relation of muriatic acid to water must
now be considered. It has been stated that
water at the common temperature and pressure,
absorbs 400 or more times its bulk of the acid
gas; that is, rather less than its own weight.
Now, 3 atoms of water weigh 24, and 1 atom of
the acid gas weighs 22; it seems probable, then,
that the strongest liquid acid that can well be
exhibited, is a compound of 1 atom of acid
and 3 of water, or contains about 48 per cent.
acid. It is seldom sold of more than half this
strength. Mr. Kirwan’s table of the strength

of muriatic acid of different specific gravities is
very nearly correct ; which, with some little
addition and modification, is as follows :

measures ; this is convenient in practice to
prevent the trouble of weighing the acid ; the
fourth contains the specific gravity of the liquid
acid ; and the fifth contains the temperature
at which acids of the various strengths boil.
This last is entirely new, I apprehend ; it
shews a remarkable gradation of temperature :
the strong acid boils at a moderate heat; as
the acid weakens, the boiling temperature
rises till it gets to 232°; after which it gra-
dually drops again to 212°. When an acid
below 12 per cent. is boiled, it loses part of
its quantity, but the remainder, J find, is con-
centrated ; on the other hand, an acid stronger
than 12 per cent, is rendered more dilute by
boiling. It avpears from a paper of Dr. R.
Percival in the 4th vol. of the Irish Transac-
tions, that in the ordinary process of manu-
facturing the muriatic acid, the middle pro-
duct is usually of the strength which boils at
the maximum temperature; but the first and
Jast products are much stronger. The reasons
for these facts will probably be found in the
gtadation of temperature in the above column,

8. Oxymuriatic Acid.

The highly interesting compound, now de-
nominated oxymuriatic acid, was discovered
by Scheele, in 1774. It may be procured by
applying a moderate heat to a mixture of mu-
riatic acid and oxide of manganese or red
lead ; a yellowish coloured gas ascends, which
may be received over water ; it is oxymuriatic
acid gas. But this gas, which is largely ob-
tained for the purposes of bleaching, is usually
got from a mixture of equal weights of com-
mon salt (muriate of soda), oxide of manga-
nese, and a dilute sulphuric acid of the strength
1.4; a heat at least equal to that of boiling
water, seems required for the expulsion of the
whole of the acid gas. Some of its properties
are:

1, It has a pungent and suffocating smell,
exceeding most other gases in these respects,
and it ishighly deleterious. Its specific gra-
vity I find to be 2.34, that of common air be-
ing 1. Or, 100 cubic inches of it, at com-
mon pressure and temperature, weigh 721
grains.

2. Oxymuriatic acid gas is absorbed by
water, but in a very small degree compared
with muriatic acid gas. I find that at the

--- Page 326 ---
298 OXYGEN WITH HYDROGEN,

temperature of 60° and common pressure of
pure gas, water takes up about twice its bulk
of the gas. If the gas be diluted with air,
then much less is absorbed, but the quantity
is not proportionate to the abstract pressure of
the gas, as is the case with those gases men-
tioned at page 201. Thus, if the pressure of
oxymuriatic acid gas be }th of atmospheric
pressure, water will be found to take up 3ds
of its bulk, which is more than twice the quan-
tity it ought to take by the rule of proportion,
Hence it is evident, that the absorption of this
gas by water, is partly of a mechanical and
partly of a chemical nature.

3. Water impregnated with the gas is called
liquid oxymuriatic acid. It has the same
odour as the gas, and an astringent, not acid,
taste. When exposed to the light of the sun,
the liquid acid is gradually decomposed, as
was first observed by Berthollet, into its ele-
ments, muriatic acid and oxygenous gas; the
former remains combined with the water, and
the latter assumes the gaseous form. Neither
light nor heat has been found to decompose the
acid gas

4. Thisacid, in the gaseous state or combined
with water, has a singular effect on colouring
matter. Instead of converting vegetable blue
into red, as other acids do, it abstracts colours

--- Page 327 ---
OXYMURIATIC. ACID. 295

in general from bodies, leaving them white or
colourless. The oxygen combines with the
colouring principle, and the. muriatic acid re-
maining dissolves the compound. Hence the
use of this acid in bleaching.

5. Combustible bodies burn in oxymuriatic
acid gas more quickly than in common air,
and the combustion is attended with several
remarkable phenomena. Some bodies spon-
taneously take fire in this gas. All the metals
are oxidized by this acid, and afterwards dis-
solved, forming salts denominated muriates.
The combustible gases, mixed in due propor-
tions with this acid gas, are either burned im-
mediately, as sulphurous acid, sulphuretted
hydrogen, nitrous gas, &c. or the mixture is
capable of being exploded by an electric spark,
as hydrogen, carburetted hydrogen, &c. These
facts shew that the oxygen which combines
with muriatic acid to form oxymuriatic, is ea-
sily abstracted again to enter into almost any
other combination.

6. Oxymuriatic acid seems to combine rea-
dily with the fixed alkalis and the earths when
dissolved in water ; but it decomposes ammo-
nia. It is remarkable, however, that few, if
any, neutralized dry salts are to be obtained.
When the saturated solutions are evaporated
and crystallized, two distinct salts are chiefly

500 OXYGEN WITH HYDROGEN.

obtained ; the one a simple muriate, and the
other a hyperoxygenized muriate,' in which an
acid with an enormous quantity of oxygen is
found, and is hence called hyperorymuriatic
acid.

7. One very remarkable property of oxymu-
riatic acid has recently occurred to me in a
course of experiments upon it. Cruickshanks
had found that if hydrogen and oxymuriatic
acid gases were mixed together, and kept in a
well stopped bottle for 24 hours, when the
stopper was withdrawn under water, the gases
disappeared, and water took their place. Be-
ing desirous to ascertain the time more defi-
nitely, I made the mixture in a narrow eudio-
meter, and left it to stand over water ; in about
three quarters of an- hour the greater part of
the mixture had disappeared. In the next
experiment, the gases, after being put toge-
ther, seemed to have no effect for one or two
minutes, when suddenly the mixture began to
diminish with rapidity, like one of common air
and nitrous gas, except that there were no red
fumes. The diminution went on, till in two
or three minutes nearly the whole had dis-
appeared. On repeating the experiment a
Tew hours afterwards no such diminution was
observed. I recollected that the sun had shone
upon the instrument in the former one ; it was

--- Page 329 ---
OXYMURIATIC ACID. S01

again placed in the direct rays of the sun, and
the diminution was rapid as before. Upon
repeating the experiment with sundry varia-
tions, it was confirmed, that Light is the occa-
sion of this rapid combustion of hydrogen in
oxymuriatic acid gas ; that the more powerful
the light, the more rapid is the diminution of
the mixture ; and that if the eudiometer be
covered by an opake body, the mixture will
scarcely be affected with any diminution for a
day, and will not completely disappear in two
or three weeks. Moreover, when the dimi-
nution is going on with speed, if the hand, or
any opake body, is interposed to cut off the solar
light, the diminution is instantly suspended.
These observations equally apply to mixtures
of carburetted hydrogen and carbonic oxide
with the acid gas, except that the former de-
posits some charcoal. Carbonic acid, water,
and muriatic acid, are the results—These facts
were ascertained in June 1809. In the ensu-
ing month, | found that upon mixing hydro-
gen and oxymuriatic acid in a strong phial
capable of containing 600 grains of water,
and exposing the mixture to the solar rays, an
explosion almost instantly took place with a
loud report, just as if it had received an electric
spark. If the stopper was well closed, a va-
cuum nearly was formed, which was instantly

--- Page 330 ---
$02 OXYGEN WITH HYDROGEN,

filled with water when the stopper was drawn
out under water ; but it generally happened
that the stopper was expelled with violence.

Tt remains now to point out the constitution
of this acid. All experience shews, that it is
a compound of muriatic acid and oxygen ; but
the exact proportion has not hitherto been
ascertained. Berthollet, who investigated the
subject by impregnating water with the acid
gas, and then exposing it to the solar rays till
the oxygen was liberated, found it to consist
of 89 parts of muriatic acid, and 11 of oxy-
gen, by weight. Whether all the oxygen is
liberated in this way is more than doubtful ;
the quantity of oxygen is certainly much under-
rated. Chenevix makes 84 muriatic acid and
16 oxygen to constitute this acid ; he too has
the oxygen too low ; probably because he es-
timated all the salt formed by this acid to be
simple muriate, or hyperoxymuriate ; but there
is no doubt that oxymuriate does exist in the
mixture, because it possesses the property of
bleaching. Of all the authors I have seen,
Cruickshank comes the nearest to the truth ;
he says, 2 measures of hydrogen require 2.3
measures of oxymuriatic acid to saturate them ;
and it is known that they require 1 of oxygen ;
hence he infers, that 2.3 measures of this acid
gas contain 1 measure of oxygen. From this

--- Page 331 ---
OXYMURIATIC ACID. 303

it may be inferred, that 100 measures of the
acid gas would afford 45.5 measures of oxy-
genous gas, anda certain unknown measure
of muriatic acid (not 56.5, as Dr. Thomson has
inferred). Chenevix remarks, that Cruick-
shank’s gas was obtained from hyperoxymuriate
of potash, and that ‘the substance. he ob-
© tained was, in fact, not oxygenized muriatic
“acid gas, but a mixture of that gas with hy-
* peroxygenized muriatic acid.’ Dr. Thomson
observes, that ‘ when water, impregnated with
* oxymuriatic acid gas, obtained by Cruick-
shank’s method, is mixed with liquid ammo-
© nia, scarcely any gas is extricated. The two
“bodies combine and form a salt.” I do not
know what reasons these two authors may have
had for making these remarks ; but, accord-
ing to my experience, they are entirely with-
out foundation. The acid gas obtained from
a mixture of sulphuric acid, muriate of soda,
and manganese, or from muriatic acid and
manganese, or from hyperoxymuriate of pot-
ash and muriatic acid, are all precisely the
same, whether we consider their action upon
the combustible gases, upon liquid or aeriform
ammonia, or their absorbability by water.
There is indeed one small difference, but it
does not seem productive of any material ef-
fect ; the gases obtained by the two former

--- Page 332 ---
304 OXYGEN WITH HYDROGEN.

methods always deposit some brown oxide of
manganese when treated with ammonia, but
that obtained by the last deposits none. The
action of muriatic acid on hyperoxymuriate of
potash, evidently consists in detaching the
superfluous oxygen from the compound, and
not the hyperoxymuriatic acid particle from the
particle of potash.

As the oxymuriatic acid is of great and in-
creasing importance in a theoretical as well as
practical point of view, I have spent much
time in endeavouring to ascertain the pro-
portion of its elements, and have, I think,
succeeded ; at least, I am pretty well satisfied
myselfas to its constitution : the methods I have
taken are both synthetical and analytical, but I
chiefly rely upon the latter.

1. I filled a eudiometer with dry mercury,
and sent up 13 water grain measures of muri-
atic acid gas, to which were added 9 measures
of oxygenous gas of 77 per cent. purity, which
consequently consisted of 7 oxygen and 2 azote.
The instrument had platina wires. About
1300 smail electric shocks were passed through
the mixture of gases; a gradual diminution
ensued ; the mercury became foul, the same
as when oxymuriatic acid is in contact with it.
The 22 measures were reduced to 4, which
were not diminished by washing. ‘To these 4

--- Page 333 ---
OXY¥MURIATIC ACID. 305

measures, 20 hydrogen and 20 common air
were added, and the mixture being exploded,
the diminution was 15 measures, correspond-
ing to 5 oxygen; but the common air con-
tained only 4 oxygen; therefore, 1 measure of
oxygen must have been in the residuary gas,
and probably 1 of azote was originally in the
muriatic acid. Here then, it seems, 12 mea-
sures of muriatic acid united to 6 measures of
oxygen to form oxymuriatic acid.—If we cal-
culate from the specific gravities of the three
elastic fluids, it will appear that 12 measures
of muriatic acid gas, + 6 measures of oxygen
gas, ought to make 11 measures of oxymu-
riatic acid gas. This result is nearly right ;
but the process is too laborious to be often re-
peated, especially as the object can be ob-
tained much more easily and elegantly by the
analytic method.

2, Oxymuriatic acid gas and hydrogen,
mixed together over water, explode with an
electric spark, much like a mixture of com-
mon air and hydrogen. Cruickshank mixed 3
measures of hydrogen with 4 of the acid, and
exploded them over mercury: in this case,
there was a residuum of acid gas. He then
mixed 4 measures with 4, and after the ex-
plosion found a residuum of hydrogen. From
these experiments, he infers, that 3 measures

--- Page 334 ---
506 OXYGEN WITH HYDROGEN.

of hydrogen require 34 of the acid to saturate
them. I have found the results a little differ-
ent ; but the error is not much, and is what
might be expected. Whether we treat oxy-
muriatic acid over mercury or water, we are
sure to lose some of it; and unless the loss can
be estimated and allowed for, we are apt to
overrate the acid required. Before the action
of light on this mixture was discovered, I used
to mix known quantities of the two gases to-
gether, in a graduated eudiometer of Volta,
over water; and, after letting the mixture
stand a few minutes, in order to 2 complete
diffusion, I passed a spark through, but no-
ticed the moment before at what degree the
mixture stood ; in this way, when there is an
excess of hydrogen, the results are accurate ;
the total diminution can be found, and the re-
siduary gas can be analyzed to find the hy-
drogen left, and the common air (if any),
which is extremely apt to be found in a greater
or less degree, in all oxymuriatic acid obtained
over water. By frequent careful trials, I found
that a measure of hydrogen required as near
as possible an equal measure of the acid to sa-
turate it. But since the effect of solar light
was discovered, I have operated in a more
simple and elegant manner ; and the results
appear rather more uniform and accurate, I

OXYMURIATIC ACID. 307

take a graduated tube, capable of containing
200 measures of gas, 1 fill this with water,
and transfer into it 100 measures of hydrogen
of known purity; to this a quantity of acid
gas is added, so as to fill the tube nearly.
The finger is then applied to the end of the
tube, and it is instantly transferred to a jar of
mercury. The whole is then taken, and ex-
posed to the sun, (if not shining too power-
fully, in which case an explosion may be ap-
prehended) or to the strongest light that can
be obtained ; when, after remaining two or
three minutes without exhibiting any change,
the water, and afterwards the mercury, ascend
the tube with increasing and then diminishing
velocity, till they nearly reach the top. The
residuary gas may then be examined, and the
quantity of hydrogen, acid and common air,
ascertained. The quantity of water in the
tube becomes visible as the mercury ascends,
and is useful to prevent the action of the acid
on the mercury. The water must be sub-
tracted from the capacity of the tube, to find
the volume of gases employed, from which
taking the hydrogen, there remains the
acid, &c.

From the mean of five experiments executed
as above, I am induced to conclude, that 100
measures of hydrogen require 94 measures of

--- Page 336 ---
308 OXYGEN WITH HYDROGEN.

oxymuriatic acid gas to convert them into
water. In every one of the experiments, the
acid was less than the hydrogen.

The above experiments are highly amusing
in a day of clouds and gleams; the presence
of the direct solar light instantly gives the mo-
tion of the mercury a stimulus, and it as
quickly abates when a cloud intervenes. The
surface of the mercury in the tube always
becomes fine sky blue during the process ; and
so does liquid ammonia that has been used to
decompose oxymuriatic acid ; I do not know
what is the reason in either case.

From the results above, it appears that 100
measures of oxymuriatic acid gas must consist
of 53 measures of oxygen, united to a certain
portion of muriatic acid gas. Now, 100 cubic
inches of oxymuriatic acid gas weigh 72 or 73
grains, and 53 inches of oxygen weigh about
18 grains, which is rather less than 2th of the
above. Hence, if the atom of muriatic acid
weigh 22, that of oxymuriatic acid must weigh
29; and thus we obtain the constitution of this
last acid. An atom of it consists of one of
muriatic acid and one of oxygen,united ; the
former weighs 22, the latter 7, together mak-
ing 29; or about 76 muriatic acid, and 24
oxygen, percent. Thus, it appears, that the
former experiments on the specific gravities of

--- Page 337 ---
HYPEROXYMURIATIC ACID. 309

those fluids, corroborate the recent ones on
their constitution. If the constitution of mu-
riatic acid be rightly determined, then oxy-
muriatic acid must consist of 1 atom of hy-
drogen and 4 of oxygen. At all events, 1
atom of muriatic acid must combine with 1 of
oxygen to form 1 of oxymuriatic acid. The
diameter of the elastic atom of this gas is
nearly the same as hydrogen, and may there-
fore be denoted by 1, but it is rather less; and
the number of atoms in a given volume of this
gas is to the number in the same volume of
hydrogen, as 106 to 100 nearly. It appears,
then, that the atoms of oxymuriatic acid are
rather more dense than those of muriatic ¢ acid,
or than those of hydrogen.

5. Hyperoxymurialic Acid.

The existence of a compound denominated
hyperoxymuriatic acid, has been clearly shewn
in a state of combination ; but it has not, and
perhaps can not, be exhibited in a separate,
elastic, or even liquid form, probably on ac-
count of the great weight and number of its
elementary parts. It is clearly a compound of
muriatic acid and an enormous quantity of oxy-
gen. It is obtained in combination with the

--- Page 338 ---
310 OXYGEN WITH JIY DROGEN,

alkalies and earths, by sending a stream of oxy-
muriatic acid gas into solutions of these ele-
ments, or of their carbonates in water. The acid
combines with the alkali; but in process of
time, as the solution becomes concentrated, a
change takes place in the acid; one atom of
oxymuriatic acid seizes upon an atom of oxy-
gen from each of its neighbouring particles,
and reduces them to ordinary muriatic acid ; in
this state it forms with an atom of alkali an
hyperoxymuriate, whilst the other atoms of
acid form muriates. It seems that the oxymu-
riates are difficultly attainable ; because, as
their solutions are concentrated, they are so
apt to be resolved and compounded again, as
above.

BerthoHet first pointed out the peculiarity
of this acid: but i!s nature and properties were
more fully discussed by Hoyle in 1797, and by
Chenevix in 1802. These authors made their
principal experiments on bhyperoxymuriate of
potash ; they nearly agree as to the constitu-
tion of the salt, but differ in some of the cir-
cumstances of its production. It yields by heat
about 2 or 3 per cent. of water, about 38 per
cent. of oxygen, and 59 or 60 of a salt unal-
terable by heat, which Chenevix considers as
simple muriate ; but Hoyle says it exhibits
traces of oxymuriatic acid by sulphuric acid,

--- Page 339 ---
HYPEROXYMURIATIC ACID. S11

The acid in 59 muriate is nearly 20. Hence,
20 muriatic acid added to 38 oxygen by
weight, constitute 58 of hyperoxymuriatic acid :
or, as Chenevix states it, 65 oxygen + $5 mu-
tiatic acid = 100 hyperoxymuriatic acid. This
I judge to be very nearly true. Now, if 35
muriatic acid require 65 oxygen, 22 will take
41; but 22 is the weight of an atom of muri-
atic acid, and 41 or 42 is the weight of 6 atoms
of oxygen; hence the constitution of hyper-
oxymuriatic acid is determined. An atom of
it consists of 1 atom of muriatic acid + 6 atoms
of oxygen, or of 1 atom of oxymuriatic acid +
5 atoms of oxygen ; and its weight is rcpre-
sented by Gt. We may now see what takes
place in the formation of hyperoxymuriates.
One atom of oxymuriatic acid deprives 5 sur-
rounding atoms, each of an atom of oxygen;
an atom of hyperoxymuriate thus necessarily
produces 5 atoms of simple muriate. Sup-
posing the salts from potash, their weights may
be found thus: An atom of potash weighs 42,
one of hyperoxymuriatic acid weighs 64, to-
gether = 106. Five atoms of muriate of pot-
ash = 320; the sum of both = 426. Now, if
426 :106:: 100: 25 nearly. Hence, in the
formation of hyperoxymuriate of potash, if the
whole potash is formed into muriate and hy-
peroxymuriate, there must be 75 of the former

--- Page 340 ---
312 OXYGEN WITH HYDROGEN.

and 25 of the latter. Hoyle does not inform
us on this head; Chenevix found 84 of the
former and 16 of the latter. Here then is some
obscurity. The fact, I believe, is, that there
is always a greater or Jess portion of real oxy-
muriate of potash amongst the salts formed, or
in the mass which Chenevix calls the entire
salt. Oxymuriatic acid precipitates silver from
nitrate as well as muriatic ; and as this was the
test, it is evident Chenevix must have con-
founded a quantity of oxymuriate of potash
with the muriate. The quantity may even be
ascertained. For, if 25:75::16:48. In
100 of Chenevix’s entire salt, there were then
16 hyperoxymuriate, 48 muriate, and the rest
or 86 must have been oxymuriate. Hoyle’s
experiments confirm this conclusion ; for, he
observes that the remaining muriate (after the
hyperoxymuriate was abstracted) was consi-
derably oxygenized, since with the addition of
acids it became a powerful destroyer of vege-
table colours, This could not be the case with
a muriate, nor even a mixture of muriate and
hyperoxymuriate, Besides, it is well known
that the oxymuriate of potash (or oxymuriatic
acid absorbed by potash) was largely used for
the purpose of bleaching ; now if the acid had
immediately resolved itself into muriatic and

--- Page 341 ---
HYPEROXYMURIATIC ACID. 313

hyperoxymuriatic, it would have been of no
use for that purpose.

Hyperoxmuriatic acid must then be consti-
tuted of 1 atom of muriatic acid and 6 of oxy-
gen; but as the former is probably composed
of 1 atom of hydrogen and 3 of oxygen, we
have 1 atom of hydrogen +9 of oxygen for
the constitution of an atom of the first men-
tioned acid; or it consists of 14 hydrogen +
98% of oxygen per cent. by weight. It is no
wonder, then, if this acid readily part with its
oxygen, and be apt to explode when treated
with combustible bodies ; nor if it refuse to
form an elastic fluid of such unwieldy par-
ticles.

Note on Fluoric and Muriatic Acids.

Since the foregoing articles on fluoric and
muriatic acid were printed off, I have seen the
Journal de Physique, for January 1809, in
which is an abstract of an highly interesting
Memoir on the Fluoric and Mutiatic Acids,
by Gay-Lussac and Thenard. Their obser-
vations, supported by facts, are remarkably in
unison with those I have suggested They
find that when fluoric acid gas is admitted to
any gas, and produces fumes, the gas is dimi-

--- Page 342 ---
314 OXYGEN WITH HYDROGEN.

nished, but only a small quantity ; that when
no fumes appear, no diminution takes place ;
they hence conclude, that this acid gas is an
excellent test of the presence of hygrometric
water [steam] in gases ; and observe that all
gases contain such, except fluoric, muriatic,
and probably ammoniacal. Berthollet, jun.
has proved the last mentioned gas to contain
no combined water; and Gay-Lussac and
Thenard suspect it contains none hygrometri-
cally ; but some experiments of Dr. Henry con-
vince me that it does; and I think its not
fuming when mixed with common air is a
proof of it—They observe, that when water
is saturated with fluoric acid gas, it is limpid,
smoking, and extremely caustic ; that heat
expels about one fifth of the acid, and the re-
mainder becomes fixt, resembling concentrated
sulphuric acid, and requiring a high tempera-
ture to boil it. They query from this fact,
whether sulphuric and nitric acid are not na-
turally gasiform, and owe their liquidity to
the water combined with them. They exposed
a drop of water to 60 cubic inches of fluoric
acid gas; the drop, instead of evaporating,
was increased in volume by the absorption of
the acid; and hence they conclude, that flu-
oric acid gas is also free from combined water ;
the conclusion is extended to ammoniacal

--- Page 343 ---
HYPEROXYMURIATIC ACID. 315

gas, but not to muriatic acid gas. I wonder
at their exception with regard to muriatic
acid, as every one knows it presents the same
phenomena when a drop of water is admitted ;
that is, the drop is increased by the condensed
acid, and suffers no evaporation, They allude,
however, to the experiments of Henry and
Berthollet, in which water was supposed to be
found ina state of intimate union with this
acid gas ; and they mention some of their own,
in which one fourth of the weight of the gas
was found to be water. This conclusion of
muriatic acid gas being the only gas that con-
tains water combined with it, they consider as
striking ; and seem inclined to consider water
as aconstituent of the acid, but that the oxygen
and hydrogen are not in the state of water.
Gay-Lussac and Thenard found that fluoric
acid gas, detached from fluate of lime by bo-
racic acid, does not dissolve silica, on account
of the boracic acid which it holds in solution.
Another remarkable fact was, that fluate of
lime, distilled with sulphuric acid’ in leaden
vessels, does not give the fluoric acid in an
elastic, but in a liquid form.—They observe,
as Davy had done, that in burning potasium
in siliceous fluoric acid gas, some hydrogen is
given out, amounting successively to about
one third of what would be given out by water

--- Page 344 ---
316 OXYGEN WITH AZOTE.

They seem to think that the acid is de-
composed in this case: but they have not
advanced any opinion, that either fluoric or
muriatic acid gas consists entirely of hydrogen
and oxygen.

SECTION 2.

OXYGEN WITH AZOTE,

The compounds of oxygen with azote, hi-
therto discovered, are five ; they may be dis-
tinguished by the following names ; nitrous
gas, nitric acid, nitrous oxide, nitrous acid,
and oxynitric acid. In treating of these, it
has been usual to begin with that which con-
tains the least oxygen, (nitrous oxide) and to
take the others in order as they contain more
oxygen. Our plan requires a different prin-
ciple of arrangement ; namely, to begin with
that which is most simple, or which consists
of the smallest number of elementary particles,
which is commonly a binary compound, and
then to proceed to the ternary and other higher
compounds. According to this principle, it
becomes necessary to ascertain, if possible,
whether any of the above, and which of them,
isa binary compound, As far as the specific

--- Page 345 ---
OXYGEN WITH AZOTE. $17

gravities of the two simple gases are indicative
of the weights of their atoms, we should con-
clude that an atom of azote is to one of oxy-
gen as 6 to 7 nearly; the relative weights of
ammonia and water also give countenance to
such a ratio. But the best criterion is derived
from a comparison of the specific gravities of
the compound gases themselves. Nitrous gas
has the least specific gravity of any of them;
this indicates it to be a_ binary compound ;
nitrous oxide and nitrous acid are both much
heavier ; this indicates them to be ternary com-
pounds ; and the latter being heavier than the
former, indicates that oxygen is heavier than
azote, as oxygen is known to abound most in
the latter. Let us now see how far the facts
already known will corroborate these ob-
servations.

According to Cavendish and Davy, who
are the best authorities we yet have in regard
sto these compounds, they are constituted as
under -

--- Page 346 ---
S18 OXYGEN WITH AZOTL,

Sp. grjconstitution by weight,
Nitrous gas 1.102|46.6 azote + 53.4 oxy,

Nitr. oxide 1.6146

Nitric acid 2.444
29.6 —— +71
28 —— +7
25.3 —— +7

The above table is principally taken from
Davy’s Researches: where two or more results

are given under one article, they are derived
from different modes of analysis. In the third
column are given the ratios of the weights of
azote and oxygen in each compound, derived
from the preceding column, and reduced to
the determined weight of an atom of oxygen,
7. This table corroborates the theoretic views
above stated most remarkably. The weight
of an atom of azote appears to be between 5.4
and 6.1: and it is worthy of notice, that the
theory does not differ more from the experi-
ments than they differ from one another ; or,
in other words, the mean weight of an atom
of azote derived from the above experiments
would equally accommodate the theory and
the experiments. The mean is 5.6, to which
all the others might be reduced. We should
then have an atom of nitrous gas to weigh
12.6, consisting of 1 atom of azote and 1 of

--- Page 347 ---
OXYGEN WITH AZOTE, 319

oxygen; an atom of nitrous oxide to weigh
18.2, consisting of 2 atoms of azote and i of
oxygen ; and an atom of nitrous acid to weigh
19.6, consisting of 1 atom of azote and 2 of
oxygen. Nor has the weight of an atom of
oxygen any influence on the theory of these
compounds ; for, it is obvious that if oxygen
were taken 3, or 10, or any other number,
still the ratios of azote to oxygen in the com-
pounds would continue the same ; the only
difference would be, that the weight of an
atom of azote would rise or fall in proportion
as that of oxygen,

T have been solicitous to exhibit this view of
the compounds of azote and oxygen, as de-
rived from the experience of others, rather
than from my own ; because, not having had
any views at all similar to mine, the authors
could not have favoured them by deducing the
above results, if they had not been conformable
to actual observation.

I come now to make some observations on
the results contained in the preceding tables,
and to state those of my own, which have been
obtained with labour and assiduity.

I believe the above mean weight of an
atom of azote, 5.6, is too large ; and that the
true mean is but little above 5; perhaps 5.1,
or 5.2.—I do not mean by this observation to

--- Page 348 ---
320 OXYGEN WITH AZOTE.

insinuate that the results in the above table
are derived from inaccurate experiments. In
the course of my investigations, I have had to
repeat the experiments of many; but have
found no results to which my own in general
approximated so nearly as to those of Mr.
Davy in his Researches. As knowledge ad-
vances, however, greater precision is attainable
from the same facts. As for Mr. Cavendish’s
important experiments, they were intended to
shew what elements constitute nitric acid, ra-
ther than the proportion of them; and they
were made at too early a period of pneumatic
chemistry to obtain precision.

The first line of the table contains the pro-
portions of azote and oxygen in nitrous gas, as
determined by the combustion of pyrophorus.
Mr. Davy justly considers this as least entitled
to confidence. The second and third were
obtained from the combustion of charcoal in
nitrous gas. The second is grounded upon
the oxygen found in the carbonic acid. By
making the calculation of this from more re-
cently determined proportions of charcoal and
oxygen, I reduce the azote to 5.4. The third
is derived from the azote left after combustion.
Mr. Davy finds 15.4 measures of nitrous gas
yield 7.4 of azote ; or 100 measures of nitrous
gas yield 48 measures of azotic gas.

--- Page 349 ---
OXYGEN WITH AZOTE, $21

Dr. Priestley was the first to observe that
the electric spark diminishes nitrous gas, and
finally leaves azotic gas ; he states the reduction
to be to one fourth of the volume. I have
several times repeated this experiment with all
possible attention to accuracy ; the exact quan-
tity of azote in the nitrous gas was previously
determined by sulphate of iron, and was com-
monly 2 per cent. ; the quantity of 50 or 100
Water grain measures of the gas was put into a
narrow eudiometer tube over water, furnished
with platina wires; the electrification was for
one or two hours, and uninterruptedly conti-
nued till no further diminution was observable.
To the residuary gas a small portion of com-
mon air was added, and no diminution found.
In this way, from 100 measures of pure nitrous
gas there are obtained at a mean 24+ measures
of azopic gas; or, which is the same thing,
102 measures of the 98 per cent. gas leave a
residuum of 26 azote. The deviation was
never more than 1 per cent. from the above ;
that is, from 100 measures of pure nitrous gas
I never obtained more than 25 measures of
azote, nor less than 28. I believe, therefore,
that 24 measures may be safely relied upon as
an accurate approximation,

This experiment, taken in conjunction with
the last mentioned one of Mr. Davy, is of

--- Page 350 ---
CeD OXYGEN WITH AZOTE,

great importance. It not only shews the con-
stitution of nitrous gas, but that of nitric acid
also. It appears, that by electrification ex-
actly one half of the azotic gas is liberated ;
and its oxygen joins to the other hulf to form
nitric acid. The immediate effect of the
electric shock is to separate the atoms of azote
and oxygen, which by their junction form
nitrous gas ; the moment the oxygen is libe-
rated, it is seized by another atom of nitrous
gas, and the two united form an atom -of
nitric acid which escapes into the water, In
other words, 100 measures of nitrous gas con-
tain 48 of azote; by electrification, 24 mea-
sures of azote are liberated, and the other 24
measures acquire the oxygen lost by the for-
mer, and become nitric acid, which are ab-
sorbed by the water.

A repetition of Mr. Cavendish’s experiments
will be found to confirm the above conclusion.
T have in three or four instances undertaken
experiments of the same nature, and with like
results ; but as these are of a laborious kind,
it is not so convenient to execute them. One
of these was more particularly an object of at-
tention, and I shall relate it in the detail. A
quantity of pure oxygenous gas was diluted
with common air by degrees till the mixture
contained 29 measures per cent. of azote, that

--- Page 351 ---
OXYGEN WITH AZOTE. 323

being presumed to be nearly the due proportion
to form nitric acid. The test was, exploding
it with hydrogen, and taking } of the dimi-
nution for oxygen. A portion of distilled
water was impregnated with this mixture of
gases, and put into a eudiometer furnished
with platina wires. Into this, 50 measures of
the mixed gases were put, and the electrifi-
cation commenced ; after several hours elec-
trification, it was reduced to 20 measures ; it
continued there all night without any change,
the operation was resumed next day, and
the gas was reduced to 13 measures. These
were found to be 3} azote + 9} oxygen ; or
27 azote +73 oxygen per cent. Hence it
was evident, that 29 measures per cent. of
azote were too small ; by calculation from the
above data, it will be found that 30 measures
of azote unite to 70 of oxygen to form nitric
acid. This gives 27 of azote by weight, and
73 of oxygen in nitric acid ; which nearly
agrees with the mean of Cavendish. From
this, the weight of an atom of azote comes out
5.15.—By the experiment on nitrous gas, sup-
posing its specific gravity 1.16, and that of
azote .966, the weight of an atom of azote
comes out 5.1.

With respect to nitrous oxide, I think Mr.
Davy’s calculations scarcely do justice to his

experiments. ‘The first line sbews the results
derived from the combustion of hydrogen in
nitrous oxide. rom several experiments,
Mr. Davy selects one in which $9 measures of
nitrous oxide and 40 of hydrogen were fired
together, and seemed just to saturate each
other, leaving a residuum of 41 azote ; but
this residuum must have contained a few atoms
of azote originally mixed with the oxide and
the hydrogen, and may therefore be supposed
to be overrated. If we suppose $9 oxide to
contain 40 azote, it will reduce the weight of
an atom of azote from 6.1 to 5.6. In my own
experience, equal volumes of nitrous oxide
and hydrogen, saturate each other, and the
volume of azote left is equal to one of the
other two, making the due allowance for im-
purities. This would imply that a measure of
azote + half a measure of oxygen, should,
when combined, constitute a measure of ni-
trous oxide ; but the united weights are about
5 per cent. too little, according to the specific
gravity of the oxide given above. 1] appre-
hend the oxygen this way is underrated, owing
perhaps to the formation of an unperceived
quantity of nitric acid. In the second line,
we have the proportions of azote and oxygen
in nitrous oxide, derived from the combustion
of both phosphuretted hydrogen and charcoal

in the oxide. By the former, nitrous oxide
gave an equal volume of azote ; by the latter,
21 measures of oxide produced 21.5 measures
of azote, and 11.5 measures of carbonic acid.
Now, if we suppose that a measure of nitrous
oxide contains an equal volume of azotic gas
weighing .966, and the rest of the weight,
.648 to be oxygen, the proportion will be 60
azote + 40 oxygen per cent. by weight. Fur-
ther, it is now known that 11.5 measures of
carbonic acid contain 11.5 measures of oxy-
gen ; hence 21 measures of nitrous oxide must
contain 11.5 measures of oxygen ; say 20 mea-
sures of oxide, because 20 being used in all,
and 9 pure being abstracted from the residuum,
the remainder 21 must have contained the im-
purities in all the 30 measures, which could
scarcely be less than 1. ‘This gives as before,
60 azote + 40 oxygen by weight per cent. in
nitrous oxide. The third line gives the results
obtained from the combustion of sulphuretted
hydrogen ; here Mr. Davy found 35 measures
of nitrous oxide saturate 20 measures of sul-
phuretted hydrogen, and leave a residuum of
35% measures of azote: This seems again to
shew that the azote is equal in volume to the
oxide, and consequently will give as before,
60 azote + 40 oxygen, by weight ; and the

weight of au atom of azote will be accordingly
found = 5.25,

It is remarkable, that in the combustion of
hydrogen in nitrous oxide, the oxygen (as esti-
mated by the loss of hydrogen) is usually found
below par; and it is the same with -the azote
in the combustion of olefiant gas, as Mr. Davy
has remarked; I have found it so likewise
with carburetted hydrogen or coal gas. I ap-
prehend when azote disappears, it is from the
formation of ammonia.

Besides the three compounds of azote and
oxygen already considered, there are at least
two more. One is called nitrous acid ; it is a
compound of nitric acid and nitrous gas. The
other I call oxynitric acid ; it is a compound
of nitric acid and oxygen. Priestley disco-
vered the fact that nitric acid absorbs nitrous
gas very largely, and thereby becomes more
volatile. He found that 120 ounce measures
of nitrous gas over water disappeared in a day
or two, when a phial containing 96 water
grain measures of strong nitric acid was in-
closed with the gas. “lhe colour of the acid
as it absorbs nitrous gas is gradually changed
from pale yellow to orange, green, und finally
blue green. Mr. Davy has used his endeavours
to find the quantity of nitrous gas which nitric


--- Page 355 ---
OXYGEN WITH AZOTE. $27

acid absorbs ; he estimates the blue green acid
of 1.475 sp. gr.to contain 84.6 nitric acid,
7.4 water, and 8 nilrous gas, by weight; and
he concludes that dilute acids absorb less ni-
trous gas in proportion than concentrated
acids. This subject shall be presently consi-
dered.

Priestley discovered that nitrous gas entered
into combination with oxygen upon the mix-
ture of the two gases. In this sway it is easy
to saturate one of the gases with’ the other ;
but it unfortunately happens that two or three
distinct compounds are usually formed, and
the proportion of one compound to another
varies according to the circumstances of the
mixture. By the constitution of nitric acid
above determined, it follows that 10 measures
of oxygen will require 18 measures of nitrous
gas to convert them into nitric acid. But the
mixture may be so managed as that 10 of oxy-
gen shall take either 13 or 36 measures, or any
intermediate number. As the facts relating
to this matter have not becn distinctly stated
by any author I have scen, I shail subjoin the
results of my own experience.

1, When 2 measures of nitrous gas are put
to 1 measure of oxygen, in a tube one third of
an inch in diameter, and 5 inches in length,
and as soon as the diminution is apparently

--- Page 356 ---
328 OXYGEN WITH AZOTE,

ceased, which will be half a minute, the resi-
duary gas is transferred into another tube, it
will be found that 1 measure of oxygen and 1.8
of nitrous gas have disappeared ; the mixture
is to be made over water.

2. When 4 measures of oxygen are put ta
1.3 of nitrous gas in a tube two tenths of an
inch in diameter, and 10 inches long, so as to
fillit ; it will be found that | measure of oxy-
gen will combine with 1.3 of nitrous gas, in 4
or 5 minutes,

3. When 1 measure of oxygen and 5 of ni-
trous gas are mixed together, so as to form a
thin stratum of air, not more than ith of an
inch in depth (as in a common tumbler) ; it
will be found that the oxygen will take from
3 to 3E measures of nitrous gas in a moment,
and without any agitation. If equal measures
are mixed, then 1 oxygen takes about 2.2
nitrous.

4, When water has been made to imbibe a
given portion of oxygenous gas, arid is after.
wards agitated in nitrous gas, the quantity of
nitrous gas absorbed will always be more than
exhausted water would take, by a quantity
equal to 3.4 or 3.6 times the bulk of the oxy-
genous gas. And, vice versa, when water
has imbibed a portion of nitrous gas, and is
then agitated with oxygenous gas, the quantity

--- Page 357 ---
OXYGEN WITH AZOTE, 329

absorbed will be greater than exhausted water
would take, by 2 portion which bears to the
Nitrous the ratio of 1 to 3.6.

These facts are of a nature easily to be ascer-
tained, and I have no doubt will be found near
approximations to the truth, by those who may
repeat them. They are curious and singular ;
as we have few other examples where two
gases form a real chemical union in such va-
ried proportions. If the gases be not mixed
precisely as above in all the circumstances, the
results will not be the same. But in all the
variations I have observed, I have not found
oxygen to be saturated with less than 1.3, nor
with more than 3.6 measures of nitrous gas.
It is obvious that the presence of water, and
the shortness of the eclumn of the mixed gases,
both contribute to the great expenditure of
nitrous gas; the latter probably from its suf-
fering the union to take place instantaneously.
On the other hand, a narrow tube-makes the
operation more slow, and removes the point
of union far from the surface of the water ;
these circumstances seem to increase the quan-
tity of oxygen entering into combination.

What then are we to conceive of this com-
pound of oxygen and azote, in which 1 mea-
sure of oxygen sometimes combines with 1.3
of nitrous gas, and sometimes with 3.6, and

--- Page 358 ---
330 OXYGEN WITH AZOTE.

according to circumstances takes any inter-
mediate portion? Are there indefinite grada-
tions in the compound? I cannot conceive
this ; neither do the facts at all require it. All
the products that need be admitted to explain
the facts are three. It has been shewn that
1 measure of oxygen requires 1.8 of nitrous
gas to formnitric acid, according to the results
derived from the electrification of nitrous gas ;
and the conclusion is corroborated by other
facts. It appears from the above observations,
3 and 4, that oxygen is found sometimes to
combine with 3.6 times its bulk of nitrous gas,
and that this is the maximum ; but it is just
twice the quantity requisite to form nitric
acid; it isevident, therefore, thata compound
is formed in which there are twice as many
atoms of nitrous gas as are necessary to form
nitric acid. This then may be called nitrous
acid ; and the clementary atoms consist of 1
of oxygen and 2 of nitrous gas, united by che-
mical affinity. If the other extreme, or the
minimum quantity of nitrous gas to which oxy-
gen had united, had been .9, or half what is
found in nitric acid, then this would have
shewn the union of 2 atoms of oxygen with 1
of nitrous gas, and the compound might be
called orynitric acid. Now, though it does
not appear that we are able as yet to form

--- Page 359 ---
OXYGEN WITH AZOTE. 831

this compound exclusively, yet it is highly
probable that it exists, and that it is always
formed along with nitric acid, and perhaps
even with nitrous acid, when the oxygen con-
sumed is more than 1 measure for 1.8 of nitrous
gas. When 1 measure of oxygen unites with
1.8 of nitrous gas, as mentioned in the first
observation, I conceive it is not purely nitric
acid that is formed, but a mixture of all the
three acids, in such proportions that the ni-
trous and oxynitric balance each other, and in
the sequel, when combined with water, these
two become, by their interchange of principles,
nitric acid. .

_ We shall now proceed to remark more par-
ticularly on the different compounds of azote
and oxygen: but it may not be amiss to state
here in a table their constitution, as far as
appears from the preceding views and ob-
servations.

332 OXYGEN WITH AZOTE.

1. Nitrous Gas.

Nitrous gas is formed by pouring dilute
nitric acid upon many of the metals; it should
be received over water. The best mode of
procuring it is to put a few small pieces or
filings of copper into a gas bottle, and pour
nitric acid of the specific gravity 1.2 or 1.3 on
to them ; the gas comes over ina state of purity
(except so far as it is diluted with atmospheric
air) and without the application of heat. The
common explanation of this process is, that a
part of the nitric acid is decomposed into the
elements nitrous gas and oxygen; its oxy-
gen unites to the metal to form an oxide,
which the rest of the acid dissolves. Upona
more particular examination of the phenomena,
I find, that estimating the quantity of real
acid by Kirwan’s table, } part of the acid is
decomposed to furnish oxygen to the metal,
and to yield nitrous gas, } unites to the me-
tallic oxide, and the remaining 4 seizes the
nitrous gas, and forms nitrous acid ; but in the
degree of condensation of the acid, it is unable
to hold more than } or 4 of it, and the rest is
therefore evolved. For example, 200 grain
measures of nitric acid of 1.32 strength, di-
luted with 100 water, dissolved 50 grains of

--- Page 361 ---
NITROUS GAS. 333

copper, and yielded 44 cubic inches of nitrous
gas = 15 grains. Now, 200 measures of the
acid contained 102 grains of real acid ; and 50
of copper require $5 of nitric acid, which is
nearly } of 102 ; every atom of copper takes
two atoms of oxygen to form the oxide, and
this oxide takes two atoms of nitric acid to
form the nitrate of copper (as will be shewn in
the sequel) ; whence it appears that whatever
quantity of acid is employed to oxidize the
copper, an equal quantity is required to unite
to the oxide ; the quantity of nitrous gas given
out should therefore have been 22 grains, but
it was only 15: it seems, then, that 7 grains
of nitrous gas combined with the remaining
acid to form nitrous acid, part of which was
probably volatilized by the heat excited in the
mixture.

Nitrous gas, according to Kirwan, has the
specific gravity 1.19; according to Davy
1,102 ; this last is the nearest approximation
totruth, as far as my experience goes. Its ul-
timate particle weighs nearly 12.1 of hydro-
gen ; the diameter of it in an elastic state is
-958, that of hydrogen being 1 ; if a measure
of hydrogen contain 10CO atoms, the same
measure of nitrous gas will contain 1136
atoms. This gas is highly deleterious when
inspired in a dilute state; if pure, it is in-

--- Page 362 ---
334 OXYGEN WITH AZOTE.

stantly fatal. It extinguishes combustion in
general ; but pyrophorus spontaneously takes
fire in it ; and phosphorus and charcoal in an
ignited state burn in it, and produce a decom-
position. Dure water, (that is, water free from
all air) I find, absorbs about ¥,th of its bulk
of nitrous gas ; but only ,;th of it can be ex-
pelled again by other gases: it should seem,
then, that a small portion of the gas actually
combines with the water, while the greater
part is, like most other gases, mechanically
retained by external pressure.

Nitrous gas, as has been observed, is decom-
posed by electricity: one half of the azote is
Jiberated, and the other haif unites with the
evolved oxygen, and forms nitric acid. Ac-
cording to Davy’s analysis by charcoal, nitrous
gas is constituted of 2.2 azote, and $ oxygen
by weight ; or 42 azote, and 58 oxygen per
cent. nearly ; which is the same as I obtain
by electricity and other means. If completely
decomposed, 100 measures would be expanded
to 104.6, of which 48 would be azote, and
56.6 oxygen.

Dr. Henry has recently discovered that ni-
trous gas is decomposed by ammoniacal gas ;
the two gases are mixed over mercury in
Volta’s eudiometer, and an electric spark is
found sufficient to explode them. When an

--- Page 363 ---
NITROUS GAS, 335

excess of nitrous gas is used, the products are,
azotic gas and water with a small portion of
nitric acid ; when an excess of ammonia is
used, then azotic gas, water, and hydrogen
are produced. When ammoniacal gas is sent
through a tube, containing manganese red hot,
Dr, Milner found that nitrous gas was formed.
These facts exhibit remarkable instances of
the decomposition and composition of nitrous
gas.

The degree of purity of nitrous gas is easily
and accurately ascertained, by means of a
strong solution of certain salts of iron, parti-
cularly the common sulphate or green cop-
peras. A measure of the gas is put into a nar-
row tube, and the end of it dipped in the
solution ; as soon as a small portion of the
liquid has entered the tube, a finger is applied
to the end, and the liquid is agitated ; the
tube is again immersed in the liquid, and the
finger withdrawn, when a portion of the liquid
enters: the process is repeated till no more
gas is absorbed. What remains is usually
azotic gas. The absorption is rapid, and the
operation completed in a minute. This fact
was first observed by Dr. Priestley. Wishing
to know the nature of this combination more
minutely, I procured a solution of green sul-
phate, such that 6 grain measures contained

--- Page 364 ---
.

336 OXYGEN WITH AZOTE.

J grain of the salt; its specific gravity was
1.081; this was agitated with iron filings, to
reduce any of the red sulphate that might be
in the solution, which is known not to absorb
the gas, into green sulphate. A eudiometer
was filled with mercury, except one measure,
which was filled with the liquid solution ; the
tube was then inverted over mercury, and ni-
trous gas sent up to the solution, which was
afterwards agitated. Tt was repeatedly found
that 1 measure of the solution absorbed 6 mea-
sures of the gas, and was then saturated. Con-
sequently 1500 grain measures of the solution
would have taken 9000 grain measures of the
gas; but 1500 of the solution contained 250
of salt, of which ith was iron, as is well
Known ; and 9000 grain measures of the gas
weigh 12 grains: Here, then, 50 grains of
iron united to 12 grains of nitrous gas. Now,
the weight of an atom of iron is 50 (page 258),
and that of nitrcus gas is 12. It therefore fol-
lows, that in the combination of green sul-
phate of iron with nitrous gas, cach atom of
iron unites with an atom of the gas, agreeably
to the general law of chemical union.

Nitrous gas is still used in eudiometry to
determine the quantity of oxygenous gas in
any mixture ; and on account of the ease and
elegance of its application, and the quickness

--- Page 365 ---
NITROUS GAS, 337

with which it attaches that gas, it will always
be used. It has been found, however, that
the simple mixture of the two gases is not
enough to discover the proportion of oxygen,
by reason of the different compounds that are
formed. The object may be effectually ob-
tained, by using an excess of nitrous gas of a
known strength, and then abstracting the sur-
plus by means of sulphate of iron. Some
authors prefer a solution of green sulphate of
iron saturated with nitrous gas ; the oxygenous
gas is agitated in a portion of the solution, and
the residuary gas is washed with a solution ot
the sulphate, unimpregnated with nitrous gas.
But the quantity of oxygen in certain mixtures
is ascertained with equal or greater precision,
by firing it with hydrogen in Volta’s eudio-
meter, and taking + of the diminution for
oxygen; or by agitating the gas in a small
portion of sulphuret of lime, which abstracts
the oxygen.

When nitrous gas is mixed with oxymu-
tiatic acid gas over water, an instantaneous
diminution of volume takes place. I was in
expectation that this would convert the nitrous
gas into pure nitric acid, and consequently
the quantity of oxygen necessary would be
ascertainable this way; but the two gases,
like oxygen and nitrous gas, combine in va-

--- Page 366 ---
338 OXYGEN WITH AZOTE.

rious proportions, according as one or other is
in excess. Sometimes 3 measures of nitrous
are saturated with 2 of the acid, and some-
times with 4 measures. When green sulphate
of iron is saturated with a known portion of
nitrous gas, and the solution is afterwards agi-
tated with oxygen, the absorption is somewhat
slow, (like that with sulphuret of lime) and
the quantity taken up is equal in bulk to the
nitrous gas. The liquid, from a dark red or
black, becomes of a bright yellowish red, the
oxide of iron being changed from the green to
the red during the process.

It has been made appear, that by electricity
one half of the atoms of nitrous gas are decom-
posed, in order to oxygenize the other half;
in like manner, in certain cases, one half of
the atoms of nitrous gas are decomposed to
axotize the other half. This is shewn by the
experiments of Priestley, but much more ac-
curately by those of Davy. The alkaline sul-
phites, muriate of tin, and dry sulphures, con-
vert nitrous gas into nitrous oxide. According
to Davy, 16 cubic inches of nitrous gas were
converted into 7.8 of nitrous oxide by sulphite
of potash ; that is, 100 measures gave 48.75:
he also found, that muriate of tin and dry sul-
phures changed 100 measures of nitrous gas
into 48 of nitrous oxide. These bodies have

--- Page 367 ---
NITROUS OXIDE, 389

an affinity for oxygen ; and the moment they
take an atom of oxygen from one of nitrous
gas, the atom of azote joins to another of ni-
trous gas, and forms one of nitrous oxide. In
this way, all the azote remains in the nitrous
oxide, and just one half of the oxygen. By
making the calculation from the preceding
table, (page 331) and from the known specific
gravities of these gases, it appears that 100
measures of nitrous gas should make 48.5 mea-
sures of nitrous oxide, and allow 28.3 measures
of oxygen to combine with the bodies intro-
duced. It is very remarkable that these nu-
merical relations should have so long escaped
observation.

Sulphuretted hydrogen and moistened iron
filings also convert nitrous gas into nitrous
oxide : but some ammonia is produced at the
expence of the azote, and consequently less
nitrous oxide: Davy finds about 42 or 44
per cent.

2. Nitrous Oxide.

The gas now denominated nitrous oxide,
was discovered, and several of its properties
pointed out, by Priestley : he called it dephi.
gisticated nitrous gas. The Dutch chemists

--- Page 368 ---
340 OXYGEN WITH AZOTE.

published an essay on the subject in the Journal
de Physique for 1793, in which the consti-
tution and properties of the gas were more
fully investigated. In 1800, Mr. Davy pub-
lished his Researches, containing a much more
complete and accurate developement of the
nature of this gas, than had previously been
given, as well as of the other compounds of
azote and oxygen, and several other collateral
ones.

Nitrous oxide gas may be obtained from a
salt called nitrate of ammonia, being a com-
pound of nitric acid, ammonia and water,
The salt is put into a gas bottle, and heat ap-
plied, which first fuses the salt, about 300°;
by continuing the heat, the fluid salt boils,
and is decomposed about 400°, emitting nitrous
oxide gas and steam, into which the whole of
the salt is principally resolved. The gas may
be received either over water or mercury.

The constitution of the salt, nitrate of am-
monia, according to Davy, is when crystal-
lized, 18.4 ammonia, and 81.6 acid and wa-
ter: Now, if we suppose an atom of ammonia
to be constituted of one of azote, 5.1, and one
of hydrogen, 1, as will be shewn hereafter.
and that an atom of the nitrate is composed of
1 atom of each of the elements, ammonia,
nitric acid and water, (see plate 4, fig. 36) ;

--- Page 369 ---
NITROUS OXIDE. Sat

we shall have, 6.1 + 19.1 + 8 = 33.2 for the
weight of an atom of the salt. This gives
18.4 ammonia, and 81.6 acid and water, ex-
actly agreeing with the experimental results of
Davy. The decomposition of an atom of the
salt will be found to give one atom of nitrous
oxide, weighing 17.2, and two atoms of wa-
ter, weighing 16. Whence, 100 grains of
the salt should be resolved by heat into 51.8
grains of nitrous oxide, and 48.2 grains of
water. Mr. Davy decomposed 100 parts of a
dried nitrate, that is, one which had lost 8 per
cent. of its water of crystallization, and ob-
tained 54.4 nitrous oxide, 4.3 nitric acid, and
41.3 water. Here, as might be expected, the
nitrous oxide exceeds, and the water falls
short of the calculation, but as nearly as pos-
sible in the due proportion. Thus it appears,
that whether we consider the genesis of ni-
trous oxide from the nitrate of ammonia, or
from nitrous gas (page 338), still its consti-
tution must be 2 atoms of azote and 1 of
oxygen.

The specific gravity of this gas is 1.614; the
weight of its atom 17.2 of hydrogen ; the dia-
meter in an elastic state (to hydrogen 1) is
-947 ; if a measure of hydrogen contain 1000
atoms, one of nitrous oxide will contain 1176
Most combustible bodies burn in nitrous oxide

342 OXYGEN WITH AZOTE.

more vigorously than in common air; it is
unfit for respiration, but does not so immedi-
ately prove fatal as Dr. Priestley and the Dutch
chemists concluded. Mr. Davy found that it
may be respired for two or three minutes ; and
that it generally produces sensations analogous
to those of intoxication. It is absorbed by
water to the amount of about 80 per cent. ac
cording to my recent trials. Davy makes it
only 54 per cent., but he was not aware that
the quantity is increased in proportion to the
purity of the residuary gas. Dr. Henry finds
from 78 to 86 percent. This gas of course
expels other gascs from water, and is itself
driven off unchanged by heat. It is a re-
markable fact, that water should take so
nearly, and yet not exactly, its bulk of this
gas.

Nitrous oxide, by long clectrification, loses
about 10 per cent. of its bulk ; some nitric
acid is formed, and a mixture of azote and
oxygen is found in the residuum ; but no satis-
factory decomposition is obtained this way.

All the combustible gases, mixed with ni-
trous oxide, explode by an electric spark.

Nitrous oxide can be made to combine with
the fixed alkalies ; but the nature of the com-
pounds has not been much examined.

NITRIC ACID. 343

8. Nitric Acid.

Nitric acid, formerly distinguished by the
names of agua fortis, and spirit of nitre, has
been known for three or four centuries. It is
now usually procured by distilling a mixture
of nitrate of potash (saltpetre or nitre) and sul-
phuric acid. Two parts of the salt by weight,
and one of concentrated acid,* are to be
mixed in a glass retort ; heat is applied, the
mixture becomes liquid, and soon exhibits the
appearance of ebullition, when a yellowish
liquid drops from the retort into a glass re-
ceiver. It is nitric acid, one of the most
active and corrosive of all the acids. When
thus obtained, it is usually pure enough for
the purposes of the arts; but it mostly con-
tains both sulphuric and muriatic acid: the
former is derived from the acid employed be-
ing in part distilled, espeoially if an excess of
it be used and the heat be great ; the latter is

* Authors differ greatly as to the proportion of salt and
acid: some'say 3 salt to 1 of acid : others say nearly equal
weights; but 1 acid to 2 salt is that which will nearly sa-
turate the base, and must therefore be right, unless an ex-
cess of sulphuric acid be expedient to displace the nitric,
which does not appear.

344 OXYGEN WITH AZOTE.

derived from the nitre, which usually contains
some muriates mixed with it. To obtain the
acid pure, the nitre should be repeatedly dis-
solved in warm water, and crystallized, taking
out the first formed crystals for use ; and the
acid, when obtained, should be treated with
nitrate of barytes to precipitate the sulphuric
acid, and nitrate of silver to precipitate the
muriatic acid.

The theory of this process is well under-
stood: nitrate of potash is a compound of
nitric acid and potash ; sulphuric acid has a
stronger affinity for potash than nitric; it
therefore displaces the nitric, which with the
water of the sulphuric acid and that of the nitre,
is distilled by the leat, and the compound of
acid and water constitutes the liquid nitric
acid above. Near the end of the process, the
heat is advanced to 500° and upwards, and the
acid is partly decomposed ; some oxygen is
given out, and nitrous gas, which combines
with the acid, and forms nitrous acid vapour.
This acid becomes mixed with the nitric, and
renders it more fuming and volatile. The ni-
trous acid may be driven from the liquid nitric
by heat, and then the last becomes less volatile,
and colourless like water.

The specific gravity of the liquid nitric acid
thus obtained, is usually from 1.4 to 1.5: By

--- Page 373 ---

fusing the nitre previously, and boiling the
sulphuric acid till its temperature was 600°, I
obtained a quantity of acid of 1.52. By re-
distilling with a moderate heat, it may be
obtained of 1.55, and even as high as 1.62,
according to Proust (Journal de Physique,
1799). The strength of the acid, that is, the
quantity of real acid in a given weight of the
liquid, increases in some proportion with the
specific gravity, as will presently be shewn.
Some of the more remarkable properties of
the liquid nitric acid follow: 1. It emits white
vapour when exposed to the atmosphere, ow-
ing to its combination with steam or aqueous
vapour : this is rendered more evident in the
distillation of nitric acid ; if the elastic vapour
of the acid is escaping from the receiver, it
exhibits a white cloud when breathed upon.
2. It issour to the taste, when diluted with
water. 3. It corrodes animal and vegetable
substances, and stains them yellow. 4. It
combines with water, and, when concentrated,
attracts it from the atmosphere ; heat is pro-
duced, and a small increase of density. With
snow it produces a great degree of cold, and
instant liquefaction. 5. It is said to be de-
composed by the solar light, giving out oxy-
gen, and becoming orange coloured. 6, It
inflames several combustibles, such as very dry

charcoal, essential oils, &c. 7. When dis-
tilled over sulphur, it converts the sulphur
into sulphuric acid. 8. Tt oxidizes the metals,
as has been observed, and gives out nitrous
gas. 9. When the vapour of nitric acid is
passed through a red hot earthen tube, the
acid is decomposed into oxygen and azote.
The same decomposition is effected by heating
nitre red hot in an iron or earthenware retort.
10. It unites to the alkalies, earths, and me-
tallic oxides, forming salts denominated 2/-
trates.

One of the most important considerations
relative to nitric acid is the determination of
the quantity of real acid in a watery solution
of a given specific gravity. This subject has
engaged the attention of several eminent che-
mists, particularly Kirwan, Davy, and Ber-
thollet. Their results are widely different.
For instance ; in an acid of 1.298 sp. gravity,
Kirwan says the real acid is 363 per cent.
Davy says 48, and Berthollet 32 or 53. (See
Journal de Physique, March 1807).* My
experience in regard to this particular has

* Berthollet, by mistake, makes Davy represent the
acid in question to contain 5+ per cent. of acid; but it is
the water which he says is 54 per cent. and the acid 46,
when the sp. gravity is 1.283; so that the difference, great
as it is, is not quite so enormous,

--- Page 375 ---
NITRIC ACID, 347

been considerable, and I shall now state it
briefly

Nitric acid has been stated, on the authority
of Bergman, to boil at 248°. This is true, if it
relate to acid of the strength 1.42; but to
acids of no other strength ; in fact, it fs the
highest possible boiling point of the liquid
acid: but if the acid be stronger or weaker,
then the farther it deviates from 1.42, the less
is the temperature at which it boils. The
weakest possible acid must evidently boil at
212°; but the point at which the strongest
acid boils has not been determined ; it will be
found, in all probability, little above the com-
mon temperature of the atmosphere : an acid
of 1.52, I find, boils about 180 or 185°.
Proust’s acid of 1.62 would probably boil
about 100°, or about the same degree as ether.
The results of my experience will be noted
more particularly in the following table. Be-
sides this variable temperature of ebullition,
there is another concomitant circumstance,
which has been hinted at by others: In the
Paris Memoirs for 1781, Lassone and Cor-
nette had ascertained that whea weak nitric
acid is boiled or distilled, the weakest portion
comes over first; but when the acid is con-
centrated, the strongest portion comes over
first: In the Irish Transactions, vol. 4, Dr. R.

--- Page 376 ---
348 OXYGEN WITH AZOTE,

Percival has noticed some results in the distil-
lation of nitre ; 2 Ibs. of nitre and 1 of concen-
trated sulphuric acid were mixed and distilled ;
the products were received in 3 portions ; the
first was of the strength 1.494; the second,
1.485; the third, 1.442: Proust, inthe Jour-
nal de Physique, 1799, relates that he obtained
an acid 1.52 ; this being again distilled, gave
for the first product 1.51; for the second, 1.51,
nearly colourless, which he expected indicated
a superior specific gravity ; but what surprised
him more, was to find the residue colourless,
and 1.47. This residue was distilled ; the
first portion was 1.49, and the rest 1.44. In
another instance an acid 1.55 was obtained ;
this redistilled gave, first 1.62, the second 1.53,
and the residue was 1.49.—From all these
facts, it appeared to me reasonable to conclude
that an acid of some one strength, and only
one, was incapable of any change of strength
Ly distillation ; or was of such a nature, that
the distilled part and the residue were always
of the same strength and specific gravity. The
actual strength of this acid was a desirable at-
tainment ; for such an acid evidently marks a
nice adjustment of affinities between the acid
and water; or a kind of mutual saturation of
the two. By repeated experiments I find this
acid to be of the specific gravity 1.42; it is

--- Page 377 ---
NITRIC ACID. 349

remarkable also that this strength is that which
has the boiling temperature a maximum, or
248°, Any acid of inferior strength, being
distilled, the weakest part comes over first ;
and, vice versd, with one of superior strength.
For instances, by distilling part of an acid of
1.30, I found an acid of 1.25 in the receiver :
again, 530 measures of acid, 1.43 were sub-
jected to distillation ; 173 measures were drawn
over of 1.433, and 354 of 1.427 were left in
the retort: again, by boiling an acid of 1.35
for some time, it became 1.39 ; and another
of 1.48 became 1.46: in short, the continued
boiling of any acid, weak or strong, makes it
approach more and more to the density 1.42,
and to the temperature 248°.

With respect to the quantity of real acid in
a solution of given specific gravity, I find it
thus: Agrecably to the experience of Kirwan,
Richter, Davy, and my own, I conclude that
fused nitre is constituted nearly of 47.5 pure
acid, and 52.5 potash percent. Having dis-
solved 25 parts of this nitre in 10C water, I
find the specific gravity, at 60°, = 1.130, and
consequently 110.6 measures of the solution.
Any given nitric acid is saturated with pure
carbonate of potash, and reduced to the spe-
cific gravity of 1.130; the measure of the so-
lution is then found. and hence we have data

--- Page 378 ---
$50 OXYGEN WITH AZorE,

to calculate the real acid in the said solution.
Now, 106 grains of 1.51 nitric acid + 248
grains of a solution of potash 1.482, with wa-
ter, gave 665 grain measures of solution of
nitre of 1.130 sp. gravity, indicating 150 of
pure nitre. Hence 106 grains of the acid con-
tained 71.2, or 67 percent. which 1s 14 per
cent. less than Kirwan deduces it ; and this
may partly arise from the escape of some acid
by its mixture with water producing heat.
Again, 133 grains of 1.42 acid were saturated
with potash ; they gave 672 measures of 1.13
solution, indicating 152 nitre ; hence 133 acid
contained 72 real, or 54 per cent. which nearly
agrees with Kirwan’s. Again, 205 grains of
1.35 acid were saturated with 290 grains of
1.48 carbonate of potash; this diluted gave
850 measures of 1.13 solution, indicating 192
nitre ; that is, 205 grains acid contained 91
real, 44,4 per cent. which also nearly agrees
with Kirwan. Again, 224 grains of 1.315
acid, took 300 grains of 1.458 carbonate of
potash ; this diluted gave 804 measures of 1.13
solution, indicating 192 nitre; that is, 224
grains of acid contained 86.5 real, = 38.6 per
cent.; this is extremely near Kirwan’s es-
timate.

Being thus satisfied with the near approxi-
mation to truth of Kirwan’s table of nitric acid

--- Page 379 ---
NITRIC ACID. $51

I was notwithstanding desirous to discover, if
possible, the sources of error which have in-
fluenced the the conclusions of Davy and Ber-
thollet on this subject, whose results are so
different from) each other and from those of
Kirwan.

That Mr. Davy has overrated the quantity
of real acid in different solutions is manifest
from this ; he finds the acid 1.504 to contain
91.5 per cent. ; now, according to this, an
acid of 1.55 would be nearly pure or free from
water; whereas nitric acid has been obtained
of the specific gravity 1.62, without there be-
ing any reason to suppose it was free from
water. Mr. Davy’s method of combining the
elastic fluids nitrous gas and oxygen, in order
to form nitric acid pure and free from water in
the first instance, and then combining the acid
with a given portion of water, was certainly
highly ingenious, and it seems to have been
executed with great care ; but that the results
this way cannot be relied on, I am convinced
from my own experience, some account of
which will presently be given. But what ap-
pears most surprising and unaccountable in his
results, is, how the combination of 47.3 parts
of his acid with 52.7 parts of potash should
form nitre. He relates two experiments ; in
one, 54 grains of 1.301 acid combined with

--- Page 380 ---
352 OXYGEN WITH AZOTE.

potash, gave 66 grains of nitre, at 212’, and
this became 60 by fusion: in the other, 90
grains of 1.504 acid, saturated with potash,
gave 173 of dry nitre.—In all the similar ex-
periments which I have made, I have uni-
formly found only ¢hree quarters of the quan-
tity of nitre said to have been obtained above,
from given quantities of the acid. I conclude,
therefore, that Mr. Davy must have committed
some oversight in these two experiments, and
that the direct formation of nitre from nitric
acid and potash, accords only with Kirwan’s
estimate of the strength of nitric acid.
Berthollet, in the Journal de Physique,
March 1807, informs us, that he saturated 100
parts of potash with nitric acid of 1.2978
strength, and obtained 170 parts of nitre ; he
calculates the acid to contain 32.41 per cent.
real, by which we may infer that 216 grains
of it were required. Nitre, according to this,
would be 100 potash + 70 nitric acid, or 59
potash + 41 acid per cent. This is much more
potash than ever before was detected in nitre-
How are we to be satisfied that the potash
used contained no water? If it contained any
water, this would disappear in the process,
and its weight be supplied by nitric acid,
which would not be placed to the acid’s ac-
count. That this was the real fact I have no

--- Page 381 ---
NITRIC ACID. $53

doubt ; 170 parts nitre are constituted of about
89 potash, and 81 nitric acid ; the supposed
100 parts of potash were, I conceive, 89 parts
potash and 11 water, which of course caused the
acid to be underrated by 11 parts.* To prove
this, we have only to take a quantity of car-
bonate of potash, such as is known to contain
89 parts potash ; for instance, 170 parts of the
dry neutralized carbonate, or 200 crystallized,
which Berthollet rightly determines to contain
89 parts of potash, and to this add 216 parts of
the above nitric acid, and 170 nitre will be
formed. This will also establish another fact
worthy of notice; namely, that the quantities
of nitric and carbonic acid are the same to a
given weight of potash.

I shall now proceed to give the table of the
strength of nitric acid. I have copied Kirwan
for the strength due to each specific gravity,

* Since writing the above, I have been favoured with
the receipt of “ Memoires de Physique et de Chimie de la
Société d’Arcucil, Tome 2.” In this there is, amongst
other very important and valuable papers, one on the pro-
portion of the elements of some combinations, hy Ber-
thollet. The author there determines, page 53, that potash
kept for some time in fusion, still retains between 13 and
14 per cent. of water. Hence, he admits the strength of
nitric acid above given as his to be erroneous. In the
sequel, he concludes that fused nitrate of potash contains
51.4 potash and 48.6 nitric acid.

except the first and second column, which his
table has not, and the three Jast, where I think
he has overrated the quantity of acid ; indeed,
the lower part of his table is confessedly less
correct. I have already given my reasons for
considering his table as approximating nearest
to the truth; but have no doubt it might be
made more correct; I have, therefore, only
extended the table to two places of decimals
in the column of specific gravity. The column
of acid per cent. by measure, will be found
convenient for the practical chemist. The
first column shews the number of atoms of
acid and water in combination or collocation
in each solution, agreeably to the preceding
determinations ; namely, an atom of acid is
taken as 19.1 by weight, and an atom of wa-
teras 8. The last column exhibits the boiling
points of the several solutions, as found by
experiment. Those who wish to repeat these
experiments, may be informed that a small
globular glass receiver, of the capacity of 6 or
7 cubic inches was used, 2 or 3 cubic inches
of acid were put in, and then a loose stopper.
It was then suspended over a charcoal fire.
When signs of ebullition began to appear, the
stopper was withdrawn, and a thermometer,
previously adjusted at the boiling point of wa-
ter, was inserted. It may be proper to ob-

--- Page 383 ---

serve, that acids which have not previously
been boiled, or which contain nitrous acid,
usually begin to boil below 212°; but the va-
pour soon escapes, and the temperature ad-
vances to a stationary point. Nitric acid varies
in specific gravity by temperature more than
any other, as may be seen, page 44; there is,
however, an error of the press in the table
alluded to, for alcohol and nitric acid ; the
numbers should be .11, and not O11. Every
10° counts 6 upon the third place of decimals ;
that is, if an acid be 1.516 at 50°, it will be
1,51 at 60°. The expansion with me is uni-
form, and not variable as with Kirwan.

Remarks on the above Table.

1. Tt seems not improbable, but that an acid
free from water may be obtained, as repre-
sented in the first line of the table. ‘That such
an acid would be in the liquid state, but with
a strong elastic steam or vapour over it, at the
common temperature, is most probable ; in
this respect it would resemble ether, but per-
haps be more volatile. Seventeen per cent. of
water would bring it down to acid of the se-
cond line, and such as has actually been ob-
tained by Proust. This last would nearly
agree with ether in volatility. With respect
to the specific gravity of pure nitric acid, it
must be less than 1.8 ; because a measure of
that sp. gravity mixed with a measure of wa-
ter, would make 2 measures of 1.4, if there
were no increase of density ; and acid of this
density is nearly half water.* I apprehend if

* The theorem for specific gravities ist a att
where H represents the weight of the body ot greatest
specific gravity, S its specific gravity, L the body of least
specific gravity, s its specific gravity, and f that of

the mixture or ¢ompound. Hence in the case above,

acid of the second line were distilled by a very
gentle heat, when mixed with the strongest
sulphuric acid, that probably an acid free from
water would come over; at least, a concen-
tration is effected by such process in other
cases of weaker acids, The receiver should
be surrounded with a cold mixture. By dis-
tilling an acid 1.31 off sulphuric acid, I got
an acid 1.43 ; and an acid of 1.427 treated in
the same manner, gave an acid of 1.5.

2. The acid in the second line, consisting
of 2 atoms of acid and 1 of water, having only
been obtained by one person, and not parti-
cularly examined, we know of no peculiar
properties it has, besides the specific gravity
and boiling temperature ; but there can be
little doubt that it possesses other properties,
which would distinguish it from all other
acids.

$. The acid in the third line, consisting of
1 atom of acid and 1 of water, has not often
been obtained, and is therefore little known ;
it seems to be that acid which fused nitre, and
the strongest possible sulphuric acid (such as
it is to be had by that mode of concentration,
which consists in boiling the common acid)
would give by distillation, The water in this
case, I suppose, is derived from the sulphuric
acid, not from the nitre. It may, however,

--- Page 386 ---
358 OXYGEN WITH AZOTE.

be obtained by repeated distillations of any
acid above 1.4.2; provided there is a sufficient
quantity of that, and the first products always
taken, What the distinguishing properties of
this acid may be, I have not had an opportunity
of investigating.

4. The acid which consists of 1 atom of
acid and 2 of water, is possessed of striking
peculiarities. It is in fact that which consti-
tutes a complete reciprocal saturation of the
two elements. Evaporation produces no
change in its constitution ; it distills as water,
or any other simple liquid does, without any
alteration. It acquires the temperature 248°
at boiling, which is greater than any other
compound of the two elements acquires. At
any strength above this, the acid is most copi-
ously elevated by heat; at any strength below,
the water is most easily raised. Pure water
boils at 212°; pure acid perhaps at 30°; the
union of both produccs a heavier atom than
either, and requires a higher temperature for
ebullition ; but in proportion as either prin-
ciple prevails more than is necessary for satu-
ration, then the temperature at ebullition is
reduced towards that of the pure element it-
self. Proust has observed that nitric acid of
1.48, produces no more effervescence with tin
than with sand; whereas the lower acids act

--- Page 387 ---
NITRIC ACID. 359

most violently, as is well known. ‘The fact I
find as Proust states it. This would lead one
to think that acid of 1.48 was of some peculiar
constitution ; but I presume this characteristic
of nitric acid belongs to that of 1.42, rather
than 1.48 : not but that the former certainly
acts on tin, but the explanation I conceive is
this; when the nitric acid in its action on me-
tals is disposed to form ammonia, (an element
constituted of one atom of azote and one of
hydrogen united) 1 atom of nitric acid and 1
of water are decomposed ; the 3 atoms of
oxygen go to the metal, and the azote and
hydrogen unite and form an atom of ammo-
nia ; if, therefore, there were 1 atom of acid
to 2 of water, there could be 1 atom of watei
detached, which would of course join to the
remaining acid, and dilute it the more ; but if
there were 2 atoms of acid for 3 of water,
then, detaching 3 atoms of oxygen, would
leave an atom of nitrate of ammonia and 1 of
water, constituting the salt of that name, and
one surplus atom of water. In this case, the
remaining acid is not diluted with water by
the process, lower than 1 to 2. Such acid,
therefore, (which is about 1.47) is probably the
lowest that can operate upon tin this way with-
out any effervescence.

--- Page 388 ---
360 OXYGEN WITH AZOTE.

5. The acid composed of 1 to 3 water, has
not any peculiarity yet discovered.

6. The acid of 1 to 4 water, is remarkable
for being that which freezes the most easily of
all, namely at — 2° of Fahrenheit, according
to Cavendish. The strength of the acid is
such, as that 1000 parts dissolve 418 of marble :
Now, 418 of marble contain 228 of lime, and
these require 370 or 380 of nitric acid, which
therefore agrees with the acid of 1 to 4 water,
and with that only, Above that strength, or
below, the acid requires a greater cold to
freeze it—The inferior acids appear to have
no remarkable differences, except such as the
table shews ; but the temperature of freezing
descends to some undetermined point, and then
ascends again.

7. The notion of those who consider the
intensity of acid solutions to be proportionate
to the quantity per cent. of the acid, or to their
density, seems incorrect as far as nitric acid is
to determine. It is true, the acidity or sour-
ness of the solution, the power to produce ef-
fervescence with carbonates, and perhaps
other properties, increase nearly as the quan-
tity or strength ; but the freezing and boiling
temperatures, the action on metals, as tin,
&c. have successive waves, and abrupt termi-

nations, which indicate something very dif-
ferent from that gradation in action which varies
in the ratio of the quantity.

I have frequently attempted to exhibit the
nitric acid in a pure elastic form, and free
from water, but have uniformly failed. Some
account of the experiments may, notwith-
standing, have its use. In order to form the
nitric acid free from nitrous and oxynitric, I
used large receivers and quantities of gas,
amounting to some hundreds of cubic inches,
and delivered the nitrous gas to the oxygen,
and vice versd, in the centre of the receiver,
and slowly ; still the ratio of oxygen to nitrous
gas was variable. The experiments were
made over water. Wishing to exclude water
as much as possible, I procured some globular
receivers, containing from 15 to 60 cubic
inches ; to these stopcocks were adapted, so
as to connect them with the air-pump or with
other receivers. These were first filled with
oxygen gas or common air, and then partially
exhausted ; afterwards they were connected
with receivers over water, containing known
quantities of nitrous gas, and a communication
opened ; the moment after the nitrous gas had
entered the globe, the cock was turned ; great
care was taken to dry the globe previously to
the experiment, and to prevent any water en-

362 OXYGEN WITH AZOTE.

tering with the air, (except the steam which
gases commonly have, the quantity of which is
easily ascertained for any temperature). The
instant the two gases were mixed, the globe
was filled with dense orange coloured gas,
which continued without any change ; a dewy
appearance on the inside of the glass was al-
ways perceived, consisting, no doubt, of con-
densed acid and water.

The results of the experiments are below :

The residuary gas was examined after letting
in water, and washing away the acid. From
these results, it is evident the quantity of ni-
trous gas combining with a given volume of
oxygen in such circumstances, is extremely
variable, and much like what takes place in
smaJl quantitics in tubes, The coloured gas

--- Page 391 ---
NITRIC ACID, 363

is always, I apprehend, either nitrous or oxy-
nitric acid ; the nitric acid vapour is without
colour, and condenses along with the steam
on the sides of the vessel ; but the other acids
instantly colour the liquid. By inclosing a
manometer, I endeavoured to find the elastic
force, and the specific gravity of the aerial
acids ; but from the liquid condensation of a
part, I found the specific gravity variable. and
always too much. It was commonly about
three times that of atmospheric air. Mr. Davy
combined 1 measure of oxygen with 2.52 of
nitrous gas, leaving an excess of oxygen, and
calculated the specific gravity of the aerial
product at 2.14 ; but it is more than probable
that this is overrated for the reasons just men-
tioned. Reasoning by analogy, nitric acid
gas should be of the same weight as carbonic
acid gas, as its atom is of the same weight; or
about the same as nitrous oxide and muriatic
acid ; hence we may infer, till it can be ascer-
tained experimentally, that the specific gravity
of pure nitric acid, in the elastic state, is be-
tween 1.5 and 2. Nitrous acid is probably
about 2.5, and oxynitric about 2 or b

I was in hopes to ascertain the constitution
of nitric acid, by decomposing nitre by heat,
and finding the ratio of azote to oxygen ; but,
as has been observed by others, the air is of


--- Page 392 ---
364 OXYGEN WITH AZOTE,

different qualities at different periods of the de-
composition. By one experiment, I obtained
about 30 grains of air from 100 of nitre in an
iron retort ; it was received in 5 portions: the
first contained 70 per cent. of oxygen, agree-
ing with the constitution of nitric acid exhi-
bited in the table, page 331; but, the suc-
ceeding portions gradually fell off, and the last
contained only 50 per cent. oxygen.

It may be proper to remark, that the nitric
acid of commerce is sold under the names of
double and single aqua fortis ; the former is
intended to be twice the strength of the latter;
the absolute strength of double aqua fortis is
not, I betieve, uniform. It commonly runs
between the specific gravities of 1.3 and 1.4.

4, Oxynitric Acid.

The existence of oxynitric acid is inferred
from the combination of oxygen and nitrous
gas, in the second experiment, page 328 ; at
least an acid product is obtained, containing
more oxygen than is found in nitric acid. As
yet I have not been able to obtain this acid
any other way, and therefore have not had an

opportunity of examining its properties, ex-
cept upon a very small scale. I thought that
distilling the common nitric acid from the
oxide of manganese might afford an acid more
highly oxydized ; but I obtained a product
yielding the fumes of oxymuriatic acid, owing
no doubt to the muriatic acid previously in the
nitric ; for, by boiling, these fumes vanished,
and left nothing but nitric acid, as far as ap-
peared. The acid obtained from the gases
abovementioned, is only at best one half oxy-
nitric, and the other half nitric, so that it is
still but a mixture,

A. dilute solution of the acid obtained by
mixing nitrous and oxygen gas as above,
seems to possess similar properties to nitric
acid solutions. It is acid to the taste, changes
vegetable blue to red, and neutralizes the al-
kalies; whether in this last case it parts with
its excess of oxygen, I have not determined.
The atom of oxynitric acid must, it is pre-
sumed, weigh 26.1 ; it consists of 1 atom of
azote and 3 of oxygen. The specific gravity
of the acid in an elastic state is probably
about 2 or 24.

--- Page 394 ---
366 OXYGEN WITH AZOTE.

5. Nitrous Acid.

The compound denominated nitrous acid,
is obtained by impregnating liquid aitric acid
with nitrous gas. This acid, however, is
never pure nitrous acid, but a mixture of
nitric and nitrous; as is evident by boiling it,
when thé nitrous is driven off, and the nitric
remains behind. Pure nitrous acid seems to
be obtained by impregnating water with oxy-
genous yas, and then with nitrous gas ; in this
way 1 measure of oxygen takes about 33 of
nitrous ; that is, 1 atom of oxygen takes 2
atoms of nitrous gas to form 1 of nitrous
acid. The weight of the atom therefore
is $1.2.

By repeated trials I find that 100 measures
of nitric acid of 1.30 specific gravity, agitated
with nitrous gas, takes up about 20 times its
bulk of the gas. If the acid be of twice the
strength, or of half the strength, it makes little
difference ; the quantity of gas is nearly as the
real acid, within certain limits of specific gra-
vity. Very dilute acid (as 1 to 300 water)
seems to have scarcely any power of absorbing
nitrous gas, besides what the water itself has.
Hence, it seems that what we call nitrous acid,

--- Page 395 ---
NITROUS ACID. 367

is only about yth of it real acid; the rest is
nitric acid.

Mr. Davy concludes, that the bright yellow
acid of 1.50 specific gravity, contains nearly 3
per cent. of nitrous gas ; the dark orange 54,
and the blue green 8 ; the two last being of
the strength 1.48 or 1.47.

From the experiments of Priestley, it is evi-
dent that the nitrous acid, or as he called it,
the phlogisticated nitrous vapour, is much more
volatile than nitric acid; or, to speak more
properly, has less affinity for water. Hence the
fuming of the nitrous acids in great part arises.
‘This is further corroborated by the ready ebul-
lition of those acids. The acid which I ob-
tained above by saturating nitric acid of 1.30
with nitrous gas, was dark orange, and strongly
fuming : it boiled at 160°; whereas the nitric
acid of the same strength boils at 236°. It is
owing to the same cause that very dilute ni-
trous acid exhibits the characteristic smell of
the acid ; but equally dilute nitric acid has no
smell. When nitrous acid is diluted so far as
to contain just its owr bulk of nitrous gas, it
then attracts oxygen, but very slowly ; it re-
quires as much.agitation as sulphuret of lime to
saturate it,

Tt does not appear that pure nitrous acid

combines with the alkalies so as to form dry
salts or nttrites ; the concentrated solutions
seem to lose the nitrous gas, and then the n7-
trates are obtained.

SECTION 3.

OXYGEN WITH CARBONE,

There are two compounds of oxygen and
carbone, both elastic fluids ; the one goes by
the name of carbonic acid, the other carbonic
oxide ; and it appears by the most accurate
analyses, that the oxygen in the former is just
double what it is in the latter for a given
weight of carbone. Hence, we infer that one
isa binary, and the other a ternary compound ;
but it must be enquired which of the two is
the binary, before we can proceed according
to system. The weight of an atom of carbone
or charcoal, has not yet been investigated.
Of the two compounds, carbonic acid is that
which isas been longest known, and the pro-
portion of its elements more generally investi-
gated. It consists of nearly 28 parts of char-
coal by weight, united to 72 of oxygen. Now

--- Page 397 ---
OXYGEN WITH CARBONE. S69

as the weight of an atom of oxygen has been
determined already to be 7; we shall have the
weight of an atom of carbone = 2.7, supposing
carbonic acid a binary compound ; but 5.4, if
we suppose it a ternary compound.

Carbonic acid is of greater specific gravity
than carbonic oxide ; and on that account. it
may be presumed to be the ternary or more
complex element. It must, however, be al-
lowed, that this circumstance is rather an in-
dication than a proof of the fact. The ele-
ment of charcoal may be so light, that two
atoms of it with one of oxygen, may be spcci-
fically lighter than one with one. But there
are certain considerations which incline us to
believe, that the element of charcoal is not
much inferior to oxygen in weight. Oils, al-
cohol, ether, wood, &c. are compounds into
which hydrogen and charcoal principally enter;
these are a little lighter than water, a com-
pound of hydrogen and oxygen. Though
charcoal in a state of extreme division is rea-
Gily sublimed by heat, it does not assume the
form of a permanently elastic uid, which one
would expect of a very light clement. Besides,
carbonic acid is the highest degree of oxidation
of which charcoal is susceptible, as far as we
know ; this rarely happens under two atoms of
oxygen. Carbonic acid is easily resolved by

--- Page 398 ---
370 OXYGEN WITH CARBONE.

electric shocks into oxygen and carbonic
oxide ; but carbonic oxide does not appear to
be resolved in the same mode into charcoal
and carbonic acid, which one might expect
from a triple compound. One of the most
common ways of obtaining carbonic oxide, is
to decompose carbonic acid by some substance
possessing affinity for oxygen; now, oxygen
may be abstracted from a body possessing two
atoms of it more easily than from one posses-
sing only one. On all these accounts, there
can scarcely be a doubt that carbonic oxide is
a binary, and carbonic acid a ternary com-
pound.

1. Carbonic Oxide.

This gas was discovered by Dr. Priestley ;
but its distinguishing features were more fully
pointed out by Mr. Cruickshanks, in an essay
in Nicholson’s Journal, 1801. About the
same time, another essay of Desormes and
Clement was published in the Annales de
Chemie, on the same subject. These essays
are both of great merit, and highly creditable
to their authors. Before that time, carbonic
oxide had been confounded with the combus-
tible gases composed of carbone and hydrogen ;

--- Page 399 ---
CARBONIC OXIDE. 371,

but Cruickshanks and Desormes distinctly de-
monstrated, that in the combustion of this gas
nothing but carbonic acid was produced ; and
that the quantity of oxygen requisite for its
combustion, was not more than half of that
afterwards contained in the carbonic acid ;
they, therefore, rightly concluded that the gas
was a compound of carbone and oxygen, since
which it has been known by the name of car-
bonic oxide.

Carbonic oxide may be procured by various
processes ; but it is mostly accompanied with
one or more foreign gases, from some of which
it is difficult to separate it; for this reason,
when it is wanted pure, such methods must
be used as give it mixed with gas that can be
extracted. The following process answers
well; Let equal weights of clean, dry iron
filings and pulverized dry chalk, be mixed
together, and put into an iron retort ; let the
retort be heated red, and the heat gradually
increased ; gas will come over copiously,
which may be received over water ; this gas
will be found a mixture of perhaps equal parts
of carbonic oxide and carbonic acid; the last
anay be extracted by due agitation in a mix-
ture of lime and water; what remains is pure
carbonic oxide, except 2 or 3 per cent. of
common air, from the lime water. The theory

--- Page 400 ---
on OXYGEN WITH CARBONE,

of this process is manifest ; chalk consists of
carbonic acid and lime; the carbonic acid is
disengaged by heat, and is immediately ex-
posed to the red hot iron, which in that state
has a strong affinity for oxygen ; the carbonic
acid parts with one half of its oxygen to the
iron, and the residue is carbonic oxide; but
part of the acid escapes along with it unde-
compounded. With a proper apparatus, the
gas may be procured by transmitting carbonic
acid repeatedly over red hot charcoal in an iron
or porcelain tube.

This gas may be obtained, by exposing to a
red heat, a mixture of charcoal with the oxides
of several metals, or with carbonate of lime,
barytes, &c. But there is great danger in this
way of procuring some hydrogen, and carbu-
retted hydrogen, along with carbonic oxide
and acid. Indeed, all gas procured from
wood and from moist charcoal, is a mixture of
these four, varying in proportion according to
the heat and the continuance of the process.

According to Cruickshanks, the specific
gravity of carbonic oxide is .956; according
to Desormes and Clement, .924. Appre-
hending that they had both rated it too low,
I carefully found the specific gravity of a mix-
ture of 6 parts carbonic oxide and 1 common
air, at two trials; in one it came out .945,

--- Page 401 ---
CARBONIC OXIDE. 373

and in the other .94; I conceive, then, that
.94 may be taken as a near approximation to
the truth ; it is just the mean of the two au-
thors above. Carbonic oxide is fatal to ani-
mals that breathe it; it is combustible, and
burns with a fine, clear, blue flame, without
any smoke or the least appearance of dew, if
a bell glass is held over the fame. This cir-
cumstance, amongst others, distinguishes it
clearly from all gases containing hydrogen,
either mixed or combined. When mixed with
oxygenous gas, or common air, in Volta’s eu-
diometer, it explodes with an electric spark,
and is converted into carbonic acid. The cir-
cumstances attending the explosion are some-
what remarkable ; unless the carbonic oxide
amount to at least tth of the mixture, it will
not explode; and the oxygen must be at
least 4!th of the mixture. Besides, it fre-
quently happens, when common air is used
for oxygen, thata smart explosion takes place,
and yet both carbonic oxide and oxygen shall
be found in the residuum. his circumstance
disappears if the oxygen be above SO per cent
pure. It should be observed, that whenever
proportions near the extremes above noted, are
used, the results become ambiguous ; as a par-
tial combustion sometimes happens. When

--- Page 402 ---
374 OXYGEN WITH CARBONE.

100 measures of carbonic oxide are mixed
with 250 of common air, (in which case the
whole of the combustible gas should combine
with the whole of the oxygen) a smart explo-
sion ensues by the first spark ; but only 3ds of
the gas is burnt; the rest, and a corresponding
proportion of oxygen, remain in the residuum,
When plenty of combustible gas and a mini-
mum of oxygen are exploded, the whole of
the oxygen usually disappears.

Carbonic oxide does not explode by elcc-
tricity when mixed with oxymuriatic acid, at
least in any instance I have had, unless a small
portion of common air be present ; but the
mixture being exposed to the sun, a diminution
soon takes pkice ; if the light be powerful, 5
or 10 minutes are sufficient to convert 100
grain measures of the gas along with 100 of
the acid, into carbonic and muriatic acids. I
have net been able to determine, from the
Jateness of the season (October), whether the
mixture would explode by the solar light,

Pure carbonic oxide is not at all affected by
electricity. I was present when Dr. Henry
conducted an experiment, in which 35 mea-
sures of carbonic oxide received 1100 small
shocks ;. no change of dimensions took place ;
there was no carbonic acid formed, nor oxy-

gen liberated ; but the residuary gas being
fired with oxygen appeared to be pure car-
bonic oxide.

Water absorbs ,-th of its bulk of carbonic
oxide. It will be scen by reference to page
201, also to the Manchester Memoirs, vol. 1.-
new Series, pages 272 and 436, that this gas
has perplexed me more than any other,.at dif-
ferent periods, as to what class to refer it, in
regard to absorption. One reason was, that
in my more early experiments I used sometimes
to obtain carbonic oxide by means of charcoal ;
in which case it was doubtless mixed with
more or less of hydrogen ; another reason was,
that I did not agitate the water long enough ;
this gas requires longer agitation than any
other I have met with. I can now make
water take up full .',th of its bulk, or at
least in that proportion, according to the purity
of the incumbent gas.

The proportion of carbone and oxygen found
in carbonic oxide, has been found by experi-
ment as under :

Cruickshanks certainly underrates the oxy-
gen ; I always find the oxygen fully equal to
half the carbonic acid, whether fired over mer-
cury or water. Desormes’ experiments were
made over water, and are therefore rather un-
certain as to the quantity of acid; they have
evidently used impure gas. ‘Their first result
given above is the mean of nine experiments ;
the other two are extremes in regard to acid
and oxygen (Annales de Chimic 39—-page 38).
Tt is remarkable, that in one of their deduc-
tions (page 44), on which they seem to rely
most, they find the carbone 44, and the oxy-
gen 56 parts: by a previous experiment, they
had found carbonic acid to consist of 28.1 car-
bone, and 71.9 oxygen (page 41); that is, of
44 carbone, and 112 oxygen: where the oxy-
gen is just double of that in the carbonic oxide
to a given quantity of carbone. This most
striking circumstance seems to have wholly
escaped their notice.

The exact composition of this gas is easily
ascertained by exploding it with common air
over water. Let 2 parts of the gas be mixed
with 5 of air, and fired ; the residuum must
be washed in lime water, and the quantity left
accurately noted ; then apply a small portion
of nitrous gas to the residuum, sufficient to take
out the oxygen ; hence we haye data to find

--- Page 405 ---
CARBONIC OXIDE, 371

the quantity of the two gases which have com-
bined to form carbonic acid. In this way, 10
measures cf oxide will be found to take from
4.5 to 5 measures of oxygen.

The conclusion then is, that carbonic oxide
in its combustion, requires just as much oxy-
gen as it previously has in its constitution, in
order to be converted into carbonic acid. This
agrees too with the results derived from the
specific gravity of the gas. The gas may be
considered as half burned charcoal ; it bears
the same relation to carbonic acid as nitrous
gas docs to nitric acid. An atom of carbonic
oxide consists then of one of carbone or char-
coal, weighing 5.4, and one of oxygen, weigh-
ing 7, together making 12.4. The diameter
of the atom, in an elastic state, is 1.02, that
of hydrogen being unity. Or, 106 measures
of the gas contain as many atoms as 100 mea-
sures of hydrogen.*

* It will, perhaps, be expected that some notice should
be takefi here of the opinion of Berthollet, that carbonic
oxide is a compound of carbone, oxygen, and hydrogen,
and therefore may be denominated oxycarburetted hydrogen.
It was formerly his opinion that certain gases consist of
carbone and hydrogen, and hence are called carburetted
hydrogen ; others consist of carbone, oxygen, and hydrogen,
and are denominated as above. But in the 2d volume of
the Memoirs d’Arcueil, he contends that all the combustible

2. Carbonic Acid.

The gas now denominated carbonic acid,
has been recognised as an elastic fluid distinct
from atmospherical air, for a longer time per-
haps than any other. It may be said to have

gases that have been considered as belonging to these two
species, are in fact oxycarburetted hydrogen ; and that
these elements are combined in an indefinite variety of pro-
portions. That the combustible gases produced from moist
charcoal and other bodies, contain oxygen, carbone, and
hydrogen in various proportions, is a fact of which no ex-
perienced person can doubt ; but it has not yet been
shewn satisfactorily by any one, that they cannot be mude
by mixing certain proportions of two cr more of the ful-
lowing distinct species, namely, carburetted hydrogen (of
stagnant water), carbonic oxide, clefiant gas, and hydrogen.
—As lor carbonic oxide, whilst it remains an indisputed
fact, that in the combustion of it nothing but carbonic acid is
produced, and that equal in weight to the carbonic oride
and the oxygen, it will require very specious reasoning to
convince any one that it contains either hydrogen, sulphur,
or phosphorus ; vuless it be first proved that carbonic acid
contains the same. One argument of Berthollet is, how-
ever, more ingenious than any reply to it which has ap-
peared : it is this, a compound elastic fluid ought to be found
specificully heavier than the lighter of the two elementary
fluids constituting it, This is, as far as I know, universally
true ; but it dues not follow that carbonic oxide should be
specifically heavier than oxygenous gas, An atom of char-

been known, though very imperfectly, to the
ancients. Towards the close of the last cen-
tury, almost all the distinguished chemists had
occasionally turned their attention to this ar-
ticle, and its properties became gradually de-
veloped. It has received at times different
names; namely, choak damp, fixed air, acrial
acid, mephitic, and caleareous acid.

coal, it appears, is lighter than an atom of oxygen ; itis
probable, then, it would make a lighter elastic fluid, conld
we convert it into one by adue degree of heat. We cannot
judge of the specific gravity of an elastic fluid either from
the weight of the article in a solid or liguid form ; or from
the degree of heat requisite to produce the elastic state.
Water is certainly heavier than charcoal ; yet it produces
alight elastic fluid. Ether is lighter than water ; but it
produces a heavier elastic fluid, and at a lower temperature.
Carbonic oxide may be lighter than oxygen, for the same
reason that nitrous gas.is lighter than oxygen; namely, be-
cause oxygen is the heavier cf the two elements that enter
into its composition, The answers above alluded to deny the
generality of the argument ; they produce what they con-
ceive a parallel case in nitrous oxide, and nitrous gas; and
allege that oxygen, the heavier of tlie two component ele

ments, being abstracted from nitrous gas, leaves nitrous
oxide, which is specifically heavier than nitrous gas. But
if the doctrine we have advanced on this head be true, they
have mistaken half of the operation for the whole ; in the
conversion alluded to, not only the oxygen is taken from
an atoin of the nitrous gas, but at the same moment the
azote is joined to another atom of the nitrous gas to form one
of nitrons oxide.

--- Page 408 ---
380 OXYGEN WITH CARBONE

Carbonic acid gas is formed by burning char-
coal: but it is most easily obtained in a pure
state from chalk, or some of the carbonates,
by means of dilute sulphuric or other acid ; it
may be received in bottles over mercury or
water, but the latter absorbs a portion.—This
gas extinguishes flame, and is unfit for respira-
tion ; its specific gravity is nearly 1.57, as ap-
pears from the experience of all who have
tried: 100 cubic inches, at the pressure of 30
inches of mercury, and temperature of 60°,
weigh from 47 to 48 grains. Carbonic acid is
frequently produced in mines, and in deep
wells: it is known to workmen by the name
of choak damp, and proves fatal to many of
them ; it is also constantly found in the atmo-
sphere, constiiuting about ..,th part of the
whole ; its presence is easily detected by lime
water, over which it forms a film almost in-
stantly. In the breathing of animals this gas
is constantly produced ; about 4 per cent. of
the air expired by man, is usually carbonic
acid, and the atmospheric air inspired loses the
same quantity of oxygen.

Water absorbs just its own bulk of carbonic
acid gas; that is, the density of the gas in the
water after agitation, is the same as the density
of the incumbent gas above, and the elasticity
of the gas in the water is unimpaired. The

--- Page 409 ---
CARRONIC ACID. $81

water so impregnated has the taste and other
properties ofan acid. This gas is the product
of fermentation, and gives to fermented liquors
their brisk and sparkling appearance ; but it
soon escapes from liquids, if they are exposed
to the air.

Carbonic acid combines with alkalies, earths
and metallic oxides, and forms with them salts
called carbonates. Lime water, by agitation
with any gas containing carbonic acid, be-
comes milky, owing to the generation of chalk
or carbonate of lime, which is insoluble in
water. Hence this water is an elegant test of
the presence of carbonic acid.

The constitution of this gas can be shewn
both by synthesis and analysis: but more con-
veniently by the former. The experiments of
Lavoisier, Crawford, Desormes and Clement,
and more recently those of Allen and Pepys,
on the combustion of charcoal in oxygen gas,
have left no doubt as to the quantity of the
elements in carbonic acid; 28 parts of char-
coal by weight unite to 72 of oxygen, to form
100 of carbonic acid, very nearly. In this
case too, it is remarkable that the volume of
carbonic acid is the same as that of the oxygen
entering into its constitution. Tennant has
shewn that carbonic acid may be decomposed ;
by heating phosphorus with carbonate of lime,

--- Page 410 ---
382 OXYGEN WITH CARBONE,

phosphate of lime and charcoal were ob-
tained.

Carbonic acid is decomposed by electricity
into carbonic oxide and oxygen. I assisted
Dr. Henry in an experiment by which 52
measures of carbonic acid were made 59 mea-
sures by 750 shocks; the gas after being
washed became 25 measures ; whence these
had arisen from the decomposition of 18 mea-
sures of acid ; these 25 measures consisted of
16 carbonic oxide and 9 oxygen ; for, a por-
tion being subjected to nitrous gas, manifested
3d of its bulk to be oxygen ; and the rest was
fired by an electric spark, and appeared to be
almost wholly converted into carbonic acid.

Carbonic acid then appears to be a ternary
compound, consisting of one atom of charcoal
and two of oxygen; and as their relative
weights in the compound are as 28: 72, we
have 36:28 :: 7:5.4 =the weight of an
atom of charcoal; and the weight of an atom
of carbonic acid is 19.4 times that of hydrogen.
The diameter of an atom of the acid in an
elastic state is almost exactly the same as that
of hydrogen, and is therefore represented by
1; consequently a given volume of this gas
contains the same number of atoms as the same
volume of hydrogen.

SULPHUROUS OXIDE, 383

SECTION 4.

OXYGEN WITH SULPHUR.

Two distinct compounds of oxygen and sul-
phur have been for some time universally re-
cognized ; but there exists a third, the nature
and properties of which are yet in a great mea-
sure unknown. According to the received
principles of nomenclature, the first, denoting
the lowest degree of oxidizement of sulphur,
may be called sulphurous oxide, or the oxide
of sulphur ; the second, denoting a higher
degree, sulphurous acid ; and the third or
highest degree known, sulphuric acid.

1. Sulphurous Oxide.

The existence of oxide of sulphur in a com-
bined state was first observed by Dr. Thomson.
By sending oxymuriatic acid in the gaseous
state, through a vessel containing flowers of
sulphur, he obtained a red liquid, which he
denominated sulphuretted muriatic acid ; but
it would have been more properly called mwv-

--- Page 412 ---
384 OXYGEN WITH SULPHUR.

riate of sulphur 3 as its formation is similar to
that of muriate of iron, &c. in like circum-
stances. Now, it has been shewn that oxy-
muriatic acid is muriatic acid united to oxygen,
one atom to one; hence the atom of oxygen
oxidizes an atom of sulphur, and the muriatic
acid unites to the oxide, forming muriate of
sulphur, or more strictly muriate of oxide of
sulphur. This oxide of sulphur, Dr. Thomson
finds, is not easily obtaincd separate ; for when
the red liquid is poured into water, the oxide
resolves itself into sulphur and sulphuric acid.
{Nicholson’s Journal, vol. 6—104.)

When sulphuretted hydrogen gas and sul-
phurous acid gas are mixed over mercury, in
the proportion of 6 measures of the former to 5
of the latter, both gases lose their elasticity,
and a solid deposit is made on the sides of the
tube. ‘The common explanation given of this
fact is, that the hydrogen of the one gas unites
to the oxygen of the other to form water, and
the sulphur of both gases is precipitated. This
explanation is not correct ; water is indeed
formed, as is stated ; but the deposition con-
sists of a mixture of two solid bodies, the one
sulphur, the other sulphurous oxide: they may
be distinguished by their colour; the former is
yellow, the latter bluish white ; and when
they are both thrown into water, the former

--- Page 413 ---
SULPHUROUS OXIDE. 385

soon falls down, but the latter remains fora
long time suspended in the water, and gives
ita milky appearance, which it retains after
filtration. It will appear in the sequel, that 5
measures of sulphurous acid contain twice as
much oxygen as the hydrogen in 6 measures
of sulphuretted hydrogen require ; it follows,
therefore, that one half of the oxygen ought
still to be found in the precipitate, which
accords with the above observation. Again,
if water, impregnated with each of the gases,
be mixed together till a mutual saturation takes
place, or till the smell of neither gas is ob-
served after agitation, a milky liquid is ob-
tained, which may be kept for some weeks
without any sensible change or tendence to
precipitation. Its taste is bitter and somewhat
acid, very different from a mere mixture of
sulphur and water. When boiled, sulphur is
precipitated, and sulphuric acid is found in
the clear liquid. The milkiness of this li-
quid seems therefore owing to the oxide of
sulphur.

It may be proper to remark that the white
flowers of sulphur, commonly sold by the
druggists, are not the oxide of sulphur. They
are obtained by precipitating a solution of sul-
phuret of lime by sulphuric acid. They consist
of 50 per cent, sulphate of lime and 50 of sul-

--- Page 414 ---
386 OXYGEN WITH SULPHUR.

phur, in some state of combination with the
sulphate ; for, the two bodies are not separable
by lixiviation.

When sulphur in a watch glass is ignited,
then suddenly extinguished, and placed ona
stand over water, and covered with a receiver,
the sulphur sublimes and fills the receiver with
white fumes. On standing for some minutes
or an hour, the sulphur gradually subsides,
and forms a fine yellow film over the surface of
the water. The air in the receiver loses no
oxygen by this process. - But when sulphur
ignited, is placed in the circumstances above-
mentioned, it burns with a fine blue flame,
emitting some bluish white fumes, scarcely
perceptible at first; as the combustion con-
tinues these fumes increase, and towards the
conclusion, when the oxygen begins to be de-
ficient, they rise up in a copious stream, and
fill the receiver so that the stand is scarcely
visible. If a portion of the air is passed
through water, it still continues white. In
the space of an hour the air in the receiver be-
comes clear ; but no traces of sulphur are seen
on the surface of the water. The whiteness in
this last case does not, therefore, seem to arise
from sublimed sulphur, but from the oxide of
suiphur, which is formed when there is not
oxygen sufficient to form sulphurous acid ; this

--- Page 415 ---
SULPHUROUS OXIDE, 387

last is known to be a perfectly transparent elastic
fluid. Whether the sulphurous oxide in this case
is absorbed by the water in that state, or is gra-
dually converted into sulphurous or sulphuric
acid, I have not been able yet to determine.

When a solution of sulphuret of lime has
been exposed to the air for a few weeks, till it
becomes colourless, and sulphur is no longer
precipitated, if a little muriatic acid be added
to it, the whole becomes milky, and exhales
sulphurous acid ; after some time sulphur is
deposited, and the sulphurous acid vanishes,
leaving muriate of lime in solution. This
milkiness must be occasioned by sulphurous
oxide ; for, sulphite of lime, treated in like
manner, exhibits no such appearance.

As far, then, as appears, sulphurous oxide
is acompound of one atom of sulphur and one
of oxygen ; it is capable of combining with
muriatic, and perhaps other acids; when sus-
pended in water, it gives it a milky appear-
ance and a bitter taste, and the mixture being
heated, the oxide is changed into sulphur and
sulphuric acid. An atom of sulphur being
estimated, from other considerations hereafter
to be mentioned, to weigh 13, and one of oxy-
gen weighing 7, it will follow that oxide of
sulphur is constituted of 65 sulphur and 35
oxygen per cent.

2. Sulphurous Acid.

When sulphur is heated toa certain degree
in the open air, it takes fire and burns with a
blue flame, producing by its combination with
oxygen an elastic fluid of a well known and
highly suffocating odour; the fluid is called
sulphurous acid. Large quantities of this acid
are produced by the combustion of sulphur in
close chambers, for the purpose of bleaching
or whitening flannels and other woollen goods.
In this way, however, the acid never consti-
tutes more than 4 or 5 per cent. of the volume
of air, and is therefore much too dilute for
chemical investigations. It may be obtained
nearly pure by the following process : To two
parts of mercury by weight put one part of
concentrated sulphuric acid in a retort; apply
the heat of a lamp, and sulphurous acid gas
will be produced, which may be received
over mercury. The reason of this is, each
atom of mercury receives an atom of oxygen
from one of sulphuric acid, and the remainder
of the sulphuric atom constitutes one of sul-
pburous acid, as will be evident from what

follows.
Sulphurous acid is unfit for respiration and

for combustion : its specific gravity, according

--- Page 417 ---
SULPHUROUS ACID, 389

to Bergman and Lavoisier, is 2.05 ; according
to Kirwan, 2.24; by my own trials, it is 2.3.
Isent a stream of the gas, after it had passed
through a cold vessel connected with the .re-
tort, into a flask of common air ; this was after-
wards weighed, and the quantity of acid gas
then ascertained by water; it appeared by two
trials, agrecing with each other, that 12 ounce
measures of the gas weighed 9 grains more
than the same quantity of common air, and
this last weighed 7 grains nearly —Water ab-
sorbs about 20 times its bulk of this gas at a
mean temperature, according to my expe-
rience ; but some say more, others less, The
quantity absorbed, no doubt, will be greater
as the temperature is less. fence, it seems
that water has a chemical affinity for the gas;
but the whole of it escapes if long exposed to
the air, except a small portion which is con-
verted into sulphuric acid.

When water, impregnated with sulphurous
acid, is exposed to oxygen ina tube, the oxy-
gen is slowly imbibed, and sulphuric acid
formed. In twelve days, 150 measures of the
acid, absorbed by water, took $3 of oxygen,
leaving a residuum of oxygen and sulphurous
acid. When sulphurous acid gas and oxygen
gas are mixed and electrified for an hour over
mercury, sulphuric acid is formed ; but I-do

--- Page 418 ---
390 OXYGEN WITH SULPHUR.

not find that the proportion of the elements of
the acids can in this way be ascertained ; for,
the mercury becomes-oxidized, and conse-
quently liable to form an union with either of
the acids.—The two gases also combine, when
made to pass through a red hot porcelain tube.
Sulpburous acid is said to be decomposed by
hydrogen and charcoal at a red heat ; sulphur is
deposited, and water or carbonic acid formed,
according as the case requires. Whena mea-
sure of oxymuriatic acid gas is put to a measure
of sulphurous acid gas, over mercury, the sul-
phurous acid is converted into sulphuric ; but
no exact result can be obtained, from the rapid
action of the former gas on mercury.

Sulphurous acid oxidizes few of the metals ;
but it possesses the common properties of acids,
and unites with the alkalies, earths, and me-
tallic oxides, forming with them salts deno-
minated sulphites.

It remains now to investigate the number
and weight of the elements in sulphurous acid.
I have made a great number of experiments
on the combustion of sulphur in atmospheric
air, in various circumstances; but those I
more particularly rely upon, were made in 2
receiver containing 400 cubic inches : it was
open at top, and had a brass cap, by means of
which an empty bladder could be attached to

--- Page 419 ---
SULPHUROUS ACID. 391

the receiver, in ordcr to receive the expanding
air; a small stand was provided, anda watch
glass was placed on it, filled with a known
weight of the flowers of sulphur; the whole
was placed on the shelf of a pneumatic trough,
and as seon as the sulphur was lighted by an
ignited body, the receiver was placed over it,
with its margin in the water; the combustion
was then continued till the blue fame expired ;
near the conclusion, white fumes arise copi-
ously, and fill the receiver, A small phial
was then filled with water, inverted, and care-
fully pushed up into the receiver to withdraw
a portion of air for examination ; the receiver
was then removed, and the loss of sulphur
ascertained. The residuary gas in the phial
was fired with hydrogen in Volta’s eudiometer.
The loss of sulphur at a medium was 7 grains,
and the oxygen in the residuary gas was ata
medium 16 per cent. or rather more; the
weight of oxygen, therefore, which had dis-
appeared, was from 5 to 6 grains. Hence it
may be said, that 7 grains of sulphur com-
bined with 53 of oxygen ; but as the white
fumes are oxidized inferior to sulphurous acid,
it is most probable that sulphur requires its
own weight of oxygen nearly to form sul-
phurous acid. In confirmation of this, it is
observable, that no material change of bulk is

--- Page 420 ---
oz) OXYGEN WITH SULPHUR,

effected in the gas by the combustion ; and
this is also remarked in the analogous com-
bustion of charcoal. Thus, then, the specific
gravity of sulphurons acid should exhibit a
near approximation to twice that of oxygen,
as it is found to do above. Now, as it would
be contrary to all analogy, to suppose sul-
phurous acid to consist of 1 atom of sulphur
and 1 of oxygen, we must presume upon its
being 1 of sulphur and 2 of oxygen; and hence
the weight of an atom of sulphur will be 14
times that of hydrogen.

Another and more rigid proof of the consti-
tution of sulphurous acid, we obtain from the
combustion of sulphuretted hydrogen in Volta’s
eudiometer. This compound, it will be
shewn, contains exactly its own bulk of hy-
drogen ; the rest is sulphur: Their relative
weights, as appears from the specific gravity,
must be I to 14 nearly; now, when sulphu-
retted hydrogen is exploded with plenty of
oxygen over mercury, the whole of the last
mentioned gas is converted into water and
sulphurous acid ; it is found that 2 measures of
the combustible gas combine with 3 measures
of oxygen ; but 2 measures of hydrogen take
1 measure of oxygen; therefore, the sulphur
takes the other 2 measures ; that is, the atom
of sulphur requires 2 atoms of oxygen for its

--- Page 421 ---
SULPITUROUS ACID. 393

combustion, and that of hydrogen 1 atom of
oxygen; which gives the same constitution
as that deduced above for sulphurous acid.

The proportions of sulphur and oxygen in
this acid, have been variously stated, mostly
wide of the truth. We have one account that
gives 85 sulphur and 15 oxygen. Dr. Thomson,
in Nicholson's Journal, vol. 6, page 97, gives
68 sulphur and $2 oxygen ; but in his Ap-
pendix to the 3d edition of his Chemistry, he
corrects the numbers to 53 sulphur and 47
oxygen. Desormes and Clement say 59 sul-
phur and 41 oxygen (ibid. vol. 17—page 42).
According to the preceding conclusions, if the
atom of sulphur be stated at 14 ; then the pro-
portion of sulphur to oxygen will be 50 sul-
phur to 50 oxygen, or equal weights; but if
sulphur be denoted by 13, then sulphurous
acid will consist of 48 sulphur and 52 oxygen
per cent., which numbers I consider as the
nearest approximation : the diameter of the
elastic atom of sulphurous acid is rather less
than that of hydrogen, as appears from the
circumstance that 5 measures: of the gas sa-
turate 6 measures ot sulphuretted hydrogen,
which last contain as many atoms as the like
measures of hydrogen. On this account, the
diameter of an atom of sulphurous acid may

--- Page 422 ---
394 OXYGEN WITH SULPHUR.

be denoted by .95, and the number of atoms
in a given volume, to that of hydrogen in the
same volume, will be as6 to 5, or 120 to 100.

3. Sulphuric Acid.

The sulphuric acid of commerce, commonly
known in this country by the name of ott of
viiriol, is a transparent liquid of an unctuous
feel, of the specific gravity 1.84, and very
corrosive ; it acts powerfully on animal and
vegetable substances, destroying their texture,
and mostly turning them black. This acid
was formerly obtained from green vitriol (sul-
phate of iron) by distillation ; hence the name
vitriolic acid. It is now commonly obtained
by burning sulphur, mixed with a portion of
nitre, (from 2th to ith of its weight) in leaden
chambers ; sulphuric acid is formed and drops
down into water, which covers the floor of
the chambers ; this water, when charged suf-
ficiently with acid, is drawn off, and subjected
to evaporation till the acid is concentrated ina
higher degree ; when it is put into glass retorts,
and placed in a sand bath; the weaker part of
the acid is distilled into receivers, and the
others concentrated nearly as much as is pos-

--- Page 423 ---
SULPHURIC ACID. 395

sible in the circumstances. The acid in the
receivers is again boiled down and treated as
before.

Some authors have affected to consider the
theory of the formation of sulphuric acid as
very obvious ; the nitre, they say, furnishes a
part of the oxygen to the sulphur, and the
atmosphere supplies the rest.. Unfortunately
for this explanation, the nitre, if it were all
oxygen, would not furnish above ,'.th of what
is wanted ; but nitre is only $5 per cent. oxy-
gen; it cannot, therefore, supply the sulphur
with much more than ~,th part of what it
wants, if all the oxygen were extricated ; but
not more than $ or td of this small portion is
disengaged from the potash; for, the salt be-
comes a sulphate instead of a nitrate, and re.
tains most of the oxygen ii had, or acquires
oxygen again from some source. Several well
informed manufacturers, aware of the fallacy of
the above explanation, have attempted to di-
minish the nitre (which is an article of great
expence to them), or to discard it altogether ;
but they find it indispensibly necessary in some
portion or other; for, without it they obtain
little but sulphurous acid, which is in great
part incondensible, and not the acid they
want. The manner in which the nitre operates,
for a long time remained an wnigma. . At

--- Page 424 ---
396 OXYGEN WITH SULPHUR,

‘Jength Desormes and Clement, two French
chemists, have solved the difficulty, as may be
seen in an excellent essay in the Annal. de
Chimie, 1806, or in Nicholson’s Journal, vol.
17. These authors shew, that in the com-
bustion of the usual mixture of sulphur and
nitre, sulphurous acid is first formed, and ni-
trous acid or nitrous gas liberated, partly from
the heat, and partly perhaps from the action of
sulphurous acid ; the nitrous gas or acid be-
comes the agent in oxidizing the sulphurous
acid, by transporting the oxygen of the atmo-
spheric air to it, and then leaving them in
union, which constitutes sulphuric acid. The
particle of nitrous gas then attaches another of
oxygen to itself, and transports it to another
atom of sulphurous acid ; and so on till the
whole is oxidized. Thus the nitrous acid
operates like a ferment, and without it no sul-
phuric acid would be formed.

This theory of the formation of sulphuric
acid has so very imposing an aspect, that it
scarcely requires experiment to prove it. It
is, however, very easily proved by a direct
and elegant cxpcriment. Let 100 measures
of sulphurous acid be put into a dry tube over
mercury, to which add 60 of oxygen; let then
10 or 20 measures of nitrous gas be added to
the mixture ; in a few seconds, the inside of

--- Page 425 ---
SULPHURIC ACID. 597

the tube becomes covered with a crystalline
appearance, like hoar frost, and the mixture is
reduced to +d or ith of its original yolume.
If now a drop of water be admitted, the crys-
talline matter is quickly dissolved into the wa-
ter, sparkling as it enters, and the gases en-
tirely lose their elasticity, except a small resi-
duum of azote and nitrous gas. If the tube is
then washed out, the water tastes strongly acid,
but has no smell of sulphurous acid. It is
evident, that in this process the nitrous gas
unites to the oxygen, and transports it to the
sulphurous acid, which, receiving it from the
nitrous, becomes sulphuric acid. It appears,
moreover, that solid sulphuric acid is formed
when no water is presént ; and consequently
this is the natural state of sulphuric acid en-
tirely free from water. It must bé observed,
that if any water in substance is present when
the mixture of gases is made, the water seizes
the nitrous acid as it is formed, and conse-
quently prevents it oxidizing the sulphurous
acid; on the other hand, the presence of
water seems necessary in the sequel, to take
the new formed sulphuric acid away, in order
to facilitate the oxidizement of the remaining
sulphurous acid. The oxygen necessary to
saturate 100 measures of sulphurous acid seems
to be about 50 measures ; but it is difficult to

--- Page 426 ---
398 OXYGEN WITH SULPHUR.

ascertain this with precision, because the ni-
trous gas takes up the superfluous oxygen, and
begins to act upon the mercury.

Now, it has been shewn, that sulpburous
acid contains nearly its own bulk of oxygen,
and is constituted of 1 atom of sulphur and 2
of oxygen; and it appears from the above, that
half as much oxygen more, that is, 1 atom,
converts it into sulphuric acid: hence, the
sulphuric acid atom is constituted of 1 atom of
sulphur and 3 of oxygen ; and if the atom of
sulphur be estimated at 13 in weight, and
the 3 of oxygen at 21, the whole compound
atom will weigh 34 times the weight of an
atom of hydrogen; that is, pure sulphuric
acid consists of 38 sulphur and 62 oxygen per
cent.

In the year 1806, by a careful comparison
of all the sulphates, the proportions of which
are well known, I deduced the weight of the
atom of sulphuric acid to be 345 it now ap-
pears that the same weight is obtained syn-
thetically, or without any reference to its
combinations ; the perfect agreement of these
deductions, renders it beyond doubt that the
weight is nearly approximated, and confirms
the composition of the atom which has jast
been stated.

There are scarcely any chemical principles,

--- Page 427 ---
SULPHURIC ACID. 899

the proportions of which have been so di-
versely determined by experimentalisis, as
those of sulphuric acid: the following table
will sufficiently prove the observation ; ac-
cording to

Berthollet 72 sulphur + 28 oxygen.

Tromsdorf 70 + 30
Lavoisier 69 +31
Chenevix 61.5 + 38.5
Thenard 55.6 + 44.4
Bucholz 42.5 StIDEao)
Richter 42 + 58
Klaproth 42 — +58 ——

Chenevix’s result would have been 4+ sul-
phur + 56 oxygen, if he had adopted 33 per
cent. acid in sulphate of barytes, which is
now generally admitted. The method which
he and the later experimentalists have taken,
is to distil nitric acid from a given weight of
sulphur, till the whole or some determined
par: of the sulphur is converted into sulphuric
acid; the acid is then saturated with barytes,
and the weight of the salt ascertained.

Notwithstanding the above theory of the
formation of sulphuric acid was such as to
convince me of its accuracy, I was desirous to
see the manufacture of it on a large scale,

--- Page 428 ---
400 OXYGEN WITH SULPHUR.

and by the generous invitation of Mr. Watkins,
of Darcy Lever, near Bolton, I had lately an
opportunity of gratifying myself by the in-
spection of his large and well-conducted acid
manufactory, near that place. When opening
a small door of the leaden chambers, there is-
sued a volume of red fuines into the air, which
by their colour and smell, left no room to
doubt of their being the fumes of nitrous acid.
There was scarcely any smell of sulphurous
acid. From the nitrous fumes, one would
have been inclined to think that the chambers
were filled with nitrous gas. I was particu-
larly anxious to know the constitution of the
air in the interior of the chambers, and Mr.
Watkins was so obliging as to send me a
number of phials of air taken from thence.
Upon examination, the air was found to con-
sist of 16 per cent. oxygen and 84 azote.
There was no smell of sulphurous acid, and
very little of nitrous acid, this last having
been condensed in passing through the water.
In fact, it scems that the nitrous acid fumes
never make more, perhaps, than 1 per cent.
upon the whole volume of air; nor can the
oxygen be ever reduced much below 16 per
cent., because the combustion would instantly
cease. A constant dropping is observed from
the roof of the chambers internally ; these drops

--- Page 429 ---
SULPHURIC ACID. 401

being collected, were found to be of the spe-
cific gravity 1.6; they had no sulphurous smell,
but one slightly nitrous,

It is not very easy to suggest any plausible
alteration in the mamagement of a manufactory
of this article. —Nitrous acid must be present ;
but whether it is best obtained by exposing
nitre to the burning sulphur, or by throwing
in the vapour of nitrous acid by direct distil-
lation, may be worth enquiry. Loss of nitrous
acid is unavoidable, partly by its escape into
the air during the periods of ventilation, and
partly by its condensation in the watery acid,
on the floors of the chambers ; a regular supply
must, therefore, be provided ; but if this ex-
ceed a certain quantity, it not only increases
the expence, but is injurious to the sulphuric
acid in some of its applications. There must,
in all probability, be some figure of the cham-
bers better than any other, in regard to their
proportions as to length, breadth, and height ;
this, perhaps, can be determined only by ex-
perience. As water absorbs the nitrous acid
with avidity, high chambers, and the com-
bustion carried on at a distance from the water,
must be circumstances favourable to economy
in regard to nitre.

Sulphuric acid has a strong attraction for
water; it even takes it from the atmosphere

--- Page 430 ---
402 OXYGEN WITH SULPHUR,

in the state of steam, with great avidity, and
is therefore frequently used in chemistry for
what is called drying the air. When mixed
with water, sulphuric acid produces much
heat, as has already been stated in the first
part of this work,

When sulphuric acid is boiled upon suj-
phur, it has been said sulphurous acid is
formed: I have not found this to be the case.
But charcoal and phosphorus decompose the
acid by heat ; and the results are carbonic acid,
phosphoric acid, and sulphurous acid.

Sulphuric acid combines with the alkalies
and earths in general, forming with them
salts denominated su/phates. On the metals
this acid acts variously, according to its con-
centration ; when diluted with 5 or 6 times its
bulk of water, it acts violently on iron and
zinc ; great quantities of hydrogen gas are
produced, which proceed from the decompo-
sition of the water, and the oxygen of the
water unites with the metal, to which the acid
also joins itself, and a sulphate is thus formed.
When the acid is concentrated, its action on
metals is less violent; but by the assistance of
heat, it oxidizes most of them, and gives off
sulphurous acid.

As the sulphuric acid exists in various de-
grees of concentration, it becomes a matter of

--- Page 431 ---
SULPHURIC ACID. 403

importance both to its manufacturer, and to
those who use it largely, as the dyers and
bleachers, to know the exact strength of it ;
or in other words, to know how much water
is combined with the pure acid in any spe-
cimen. This subject engaged the particular
attention of Kirwan some years ago, and he
has furnished us with a table of the strengths
of sulphuric acid, of most densities. There
are two things requisite to form an accurate
table, the one is to ascertain the exact quan-
tity of real acid in some specimen of a given
specitic gravity ; the other is ta observe care-
fully the effects produced on the specitic gra~
vity of such acid, by diluting it with a given
quantity of water. Mr. Kirwan has succeeded.
very well in the former, but has been pecu-~
Jiarly unfortunate in the jatter. The errors of
his table seem to have been known for the last
10 years to every one, except the editors of
works on chemistry. The following table
exhibits the results of my own experience on
this acid for several years.

Remarks on the preceding Table.

1. The acid of 81 per cent. is constituted of
1 atom of acid and 1 of water. It is the
strongest possible acid that can be obtained by
boiling the liquid acid ; because at that strength

--- Page 433 ---
SULPHURIC ACID. 405

the acid and water distil together, in the same
way as nitric acid of 1.42 sp. gravity, or mu-
riatic of 1.094. It is a mistaken notion, that
the common sulphuric acid of commerce is of
the maximum strength, though it is of the
maximum density nearly. The fact is, acid
nearly of the maximum strength varies very
little in its specific gravity, by the addition or
subtraction of a small quantity of water. Here
is Kirwan’s principal error. Acids of the
strength of 81 and 80, do not differ more than
1 in the third place of decimals ; whereas, ac-
cording to his table, the difference is 14 times
as great. The acid of commerce varies from
75 to 80 per cent, of acid, or about 7 per cent.
in value, in the different specimens I have had
occasion to examine. This variation only
changes the second figure in decimals an unit ;
though, according to Kirwan’s table, the
change is7 times as much. The specific gra-
vity ought not to be the criterion of strength
in acids above 70 per cent. ; the temperature
at which they boil isa much better criterion,
because it admits of a range of 12 or 15° for 1
per cent. of acid. Or the strength may be
found by determining what quantity of water
must be added to reduce the acid to some
known strength, as that of the glacial acid,
of 1.78 sp. gravity,

--- Page 434 ---
406 OXYGEN WITH SULPHUR,

2. There is nothing further striking in the
table till we come to the acfd, which is con-
stituted of 1 atom to 2 of water; this acid
possesses the remarkable property of congealing
in a temperature at or above 32°, and of re-
maining congealed in any temperature below
46°; its specific gravity is 1.78, as Keir found
it, (Philos. Trans. 1787), and it contains 68
per cent. of real acid, both by theory and ex-
periment ; it is determined by theory thus :
— one atom of sulphuric acid weighs 34, and
2 of water 16, together making 50; hence, if
50: $4:: 100: 68; it is found experimen-
tally thus : let 100 grain measures of glacial
sulphuric acid be saturated with carbonate of
potash, and the sulphate of potash be ob-
tained ; it will weigh, after being heated to a
moderate red, nearly 270 grains, of which
121 will be acid, and 149 alkali, according to
the analyses of Kirwan and Wenzel. If the
liquid acid be of greater or less specific gra-
vity, so as to contain even 1 per cent. more or
less real acid, then it cannot be frozen in a
temperature above 32°, but may in a tempe-
rature a little below 32°. If the liquid acid
contain 3 per cent. more or less than the
glacial, it cannot be frozen without the cold
produced by a mixture of snow and salt ; and
that is insufficient, if it deviate more than 3

--- Page 435 ---
SULPHURIC ACID. 407

per cent. from the glacial, as Mr. Keir deter-
mined. I find the frozen acid to be of the
specific gravity 1.88 nearly, It seems pro-
bable that the difficulty of freezing would in-
crease in both sides, till the acids of 1 and 1
above, and 1 and 3 below.

3. The acids below 30 per cent. may, with-
out any material error, have their strength
estimated by the first and second figures of
decimals in the column of sp. gravity ; thus
acid of 15 per cent. strength, will have the
specific gravity 1.15, &c.

SECTION 5.

OXYGEN WITH PHOSPHORUS.

There are only two compounds of oxygen
and phosphorus yet known: they both have
the characters of acids ; the one is denomi-
nated phosphorous acid, the other phosphoric
acid. ‘It is extremely probable that the former,
though recognised as an acid, is yet in the
lowest degree of oxidation, and may therefore
with equal propriety be called phosphorous
oxide, phosphoric oxide, or, after the manner
of metals, oxide of phosphorus. We shall,
however, adopt the common name.

--- Page 436 ---
408 OXYGEN WITH PHOSPHOR¥S,

1, Phosphorous Acid.

When phosphorus is exposed for some days
to the atmosphere, it gradually acquires oxy-
gen, and is converted into an acid liquid.
This process may be effected by putting small
pieces of phosphorus on the sloping sides of a
glass funnel, and suffering the liquid to drop
into a phial as it isformed. The liquid, called
phosphorous acid, is viscid, tastes sour, and is
capable of being diluted with water to any
amount. It has the usual effect of acids on the
test colours. When heated, water is evapo-
rated, and afterwards phosphuretted hydrogen
gas ; finally, there remains phosphoric acid in
the vessel. It should seem from this, that
heat gives the oxygen of one part of the phos-
phorous acid to another, by which the latter
is changed into phosphoric acid, and the phos-
phorus of the former is liberated ; but at that
degree of heat the liberated phosphorus acts
on the water; one part of it takes the oxygen
to form more phosphorous acid, and the other
takes the hydrogen to form phosphuretted
hydrogen ; and thus the process is carried on
till all the phosphorus is in the state of phos-
phoric acid, or phosphuretted hydrogen. It
is probable, that in this way the phosphorus

--- Page 437 ---
PHOSPHOROUS ACID. 409

is divided, so that two thirds of it are united
to oxygen, and one third to hydrogen ; but
this has not been ascertained by direct ex-
periment.

Phosphorous acid acts upon several metals,
oxidizing them by the decomposition of wa-
ter, and at the same time giving out phosphu-,
retted hydrogen; the resulting metallic salts
are, it issupposed, phosphates, the redundant
phosphorus being carried off by the hydrogen,
This acid combines with the alkalies, earths,
and metallic oxides, and forms with them a
class of salts called phosphites.

When nitric acid is put to phosphorous acid,
and heat applied, the nitric acid is decom-
posed, half of its oxygen unites to the phos-
phorous acid, and converts it into phosphoric
acid, and the rest of the nitric acid escapes in
the form of nitrous gas.

The proportion of the two clements consti-
tuting phosphorous acid has not hitherto been
ascertained ; I am inclined to believe, from the
experiments and observations about to be re-
lated concerning phosphoric acid, that phos-
phorous acid is composed of 1 atom of phos-
phorus, weighing 9 nearly, and 1 of oxygen,
weighing 7; the compound weighing 16. If
this be the case, it may appear singular that
none of the other elements exhibit acid pro-

410 OXYGEN WITH PHOSPHORUS.

perties when combined with 1 atom of oxy-
gen ; but it should be observed, that the phos-
phoric oxide is in a liquid form, and disposed
to separate into phosphorus and phosphoric
acid, circumstances that do not combine in
regard to the other oxides. In fact, phos-
pherous acid may be considered as phosphoric
acid holding phosphorus in solution, rather
than as a distinct acid.

2, Phosphoric Acid.

Though some of the compounds of phos-
phoric acid. and the earths and alkalies, are
common enough, yet this acid, in a pure
state, is rarely obtained in any considerable
quantity, requiring a process both tedious and
expensive. There are three methods by which
phosphoric acid may be formed : 1. If a small
portion of phosphorus, namely, from 5 to 20
grains, be ignited, aad immediately covered
with a large bell glass, over water, the phos-
phorus burns with great brilliancy, and soon
fills the vessel with white fumes ; in a short
time, the combustion ceases ; after which the
fumes gradually subside, or adhere to the side
of the glass in the form of dew ; these white
fumes are pure phosphoric acid. 2, Ifa small

piece of phosphorus be dropped into heated
nitric acid in a phial or gas bottle, a brisk
effervescence ensues, occasioned by the escape
of nitrous gas, and the phosphorus gradually
disappears, being converted into phosphoric
acid, and mixed with the remaining nitric
acid; another small piece may then be dropped
into the liquid, and so on in succession till
the nitric acid is almost wholly decomposed ;
the remaining liquid may then be gradually
increased in temperature, to drive off all the
nitric acid ; what is left is a liquid consisting
of phosphoric acid and water ; by increasing
the heat to a moderate red, the water is driven
off, and liquid phosphoric acid remains, which
on cooling becomes like glass. 3. If phospho-
rous acid be prepared by the slow combustion
of phosphorus, as mentioned above, and then
a portion of nitric acid added to the liquid,
and heat be applied, the nitric acid gives part
of its oxygen to the phosphorous acid, and
nitrous gas escapes. What remains, when
heated, is pure phosphoric acid.

Of these three processes, the first may be
recommended when the object is to find the
proportion of the elements of the acid ; but the
second and third, when the object is to pro-
cure a quantity of acid for the purposes of in-
vestigation, Of these the third is preferable

412 OXYGEN WITH PHOSPHORUS.

in an economical point of view, because it
requires only half as much nitric acid. By
calculation, I find that 20 grains of phos-
phorus will require 200 grains of nitric acid
of 1.35, by the second process, but only 100
grains by the third; but a small excess
should always be allowed for Joss by evapo-
ration, &c.

Phosphoric acid, in the state of glass, is de-
Jiquescent when exposed to the air ; it be-
comes oily, and may be diluted with any
quantity of water. This acid is not so cor-
rosive as some others ; but it has the other
acid properties of a sour taste, of reddening
vegetable blues, and of combining with the
alkalies, earths, and metallic oxides, to form
salts, which are called phosphates. It has the
power of oxidizing certain metals, by decom-
posing water in the manner of sulphuric acid ;
the oxygen of the water unites to the metal,
and the hydrogen is liberated in the state of
gas. Charcoal decomposes this acid, as well
as the phosphorous, ina red heat; hence the
process for obtaining phosphorus form super-
phosphate of lime.

Nothing very certain has been determined
respecting the relation of the strength of this
acid to the specific gravity of the liquid solu-
tion. Some experience I have had, makes me

--- Page 441 ---

think the following table will be found nearly
correct : at all events, it may have its use till
a better can be formed.

Lavoisier ascertained the relative weights of
phosphorus and oxygen in phosphoric acid to
be 40 to 60 nearly : this was effected by burn-
ing phosphorus in oxygenous gas. This im-
portant fact has been since corroborated by
the experience of others. I find a near ap-
proximation to this result by burning phos-
phorus in atmospheric air. In a bell glass,
containing 400 cubic inches of air, 5 grains of
phosphorus were repeatedly burnt over water ;
the combustion at first was very vivid, but
towards the conclusion it was languid; there
was a residuum of moist, half burned phos-
phorus in the cup, usually about 1 grain : the
glass had a flaccid bladder adapted to it to
receive the rarefied air, so as to suffer none to

--- Page 442 ---
4l4 OXYGEN WITH PHOSPHORUS,

escape. The air at first contained 201 per
cent. oxygen; but after the combustion, it
contained only 16 or 16 per cent., the tem-
perature being about 40° at the time. Whence,
by calculation, it appears that in these in-
siances $ grains of phosphorus may be con-
cluded to have united to 6 grains of oxygen.
The data, indeed, would give a rather less
proportion of oxygen ; but it is probable that
some phosphorous acid is formed near the con-
clusion of the combustion.

With respect to the constitution of the phos-
phoric acid atom, there can be but two opi-
nions entertained. Either it must be 1 atom
of phosphorus with 2 atoms of oxygen, or
with 3 of oxygen. According to the former
opinion, the phosphoric atom will weigh 9,
and the phosphoric acid atom 25 ; according
to the Jatter opinion, the phosphoric atom will
weigh 14, and the acid atom 35. We might
appeal to the phosphates to determine the
weight of the acid ; but this class of salts has
not been analyzed with sufficient precision.
Fortunately, there is another compound of
phosphorus which is subservient to our pur-
pose ; namely, phosphuretted hydrogen. As
the properties of this gas will be treated of in
the proper place, we shall only observe here
that the gas is a compound of phosphorus and

--- Page 443 ---

hydrogen ; that it contains just its bulk of
hydrogen ; that its specific gravity is about 10
times that of hydrogen ; and that when fired
in Volta’s eudiometer along with oxygen, it is
converted into water and phosphoric acid,
requiring 150 percent. in volume of oxygen
for its complete combustion ; but is, notwith-
standing, burnt so far as to lose its elasticity
with 100 measures of oxygen. These facts
leave no doubt that the atom of phosphorus
weighs 9 ; that the atom of phosphoric acid
weighs 23, being a compound of 1 with 2 of
oxygen ; that the atom of phosphorous acid
is 1 with 1 of oxygen, weighing 16, and that
phosphorous acid and water are formed when
equal volumes of phosphuretted hydrogen and
oxygen are exploded together.

SECTION 6.

HYDROGEN WITH AZOTE,

Only one compound of hydrogen and azote
has yet been discovered: it has been long
known to chemists as an important element,
and under various names, according to the
state in which it was exhibited, or to the ar-
ticle from which it was derived ; namely, vo-

--- Page 444 ---
416 HYDROGEN WITH AZOTE.

latile alkali, hartshorn, spirit of sal ammo-
niac, &c. but authors at present generally dis-
tinguish it by the name of ammonia. Its nature
and properties we shall now describe,

Ammonia.

In order to procure ammonia, let one ounce
of powdered sal ammoniac be well mixed with
two ounces of hydrate of lime (dry slaked
lime), and the mixture be put into a gas
bottle ; apply the heat of a lamp or candle,
and a gas comes over, which must be received
in jars over dry mercury. It is ammoniacal
gas, or ammonia in a pure state,

This gas is unfit for respiration, and for sup-
porting combustion ; it has an extremely pun-
gent smell, but when diluted with common
air, it forms an useful and well-known stimu-
lant to prevent fainting. The specific gravity
of this gas has been found nearly the same
by various authors, which is the more remark-
able, as the experiment is attended with some
difficulties that do .not occur in many other
cases, According to Davy, 100 cubic inches
of it weigh 18 grains; according to Kirwan,
18.2 grains; Allen and Pepys, 18.7; and
Biot, 19.6; the mean of these, 18.6 grains,

--- Page 445 ---

may be considered as a near approximation at
the temperature 60° and pressure 30 inches of
mercury: hence the specific gravity is .6, the
weight of atmospheric air being one.

Ammoniacal gas sent into water, is con-
densed almost with the same rapidity as steam ;
in this respect it corresponds with fluoric and
muriatic acid gases. The compound of water
and ammonia forms the common liquid am-
monia sold by the name of spirit of sal ammo-
niac ; this is the form in which ammonia is
the most frequently used. It.is of great im-
portance to ascertain the quantity of gaseous
or real ammonia in given solutions of ammonia
in water. This subject has been greatly neg-
lected ; a very good attempt was made about
10 years ago by Mr. Davy, to ascertain the
quantity of ammonia in watery solutions, of
different specific gravities ; the result was a
table, which may be considered an excellent
first approximation ; but it is to be regretted
that so important an enquiry should not have
attracted attention since. I have instituted a
few experiments on this head, the results of
which will no doubt be acceptable.

A phial, capable of holding 1400 grains ot
water, was partly filled with mercury, and the
rest with 200 grains of water, and inverted in
mercury ; into this 6000 grain measures of am-

--- Page 446 ---
418 HYDROGEN WITH AZOTE.

moniacal gas were transferred ; the liquid had
not diminished sensibly in specific gravity ;
it required 244 grain measures of muriatic
acid, 1.155, to saturate the water; by evapo-
rating in a heat below boiling water, 12 grains
of dry muriate of ammonia were obtained.
Now, supposing 1400 measures of gas equal
to 1 grain in weight, there would be found in
the salt 5.7 grains of muriatic acid, 4.3 grains
of ammonia, and 2 grains of water. I found
this method of proceeding not to be relied
upon; for, though the mercury had recently
been dried in an oven in the temperature 240°,
yet the ammoniacal gas could not be trans-
ferred from one graduated tube to another,
without a loss of 10 or 15 per cent.; I had
reason to conclude, then, that the ammonia
in the above salt was overrated. In order to
avoid this source of error, I adopted the method
first used by Dr. Priestley, of putting muriatic
acid gas to the alkaline in the graduated tube ;
but here was still an objection, as the muriatic
acid gas must be measured previously to the
transfer, and it is equally absorbable by water
with alkaline gas. However, I found, as Dr.
Priestley had done before, that equal measures
of the two gases as nearly as possible saturated
each other. For, when a measure of acid gas
was put to one of alkaline, there was a small

--- Page 447 ---
AMMONIA, 419

residuum of alkaline gas ; and when the alka-
line was transferred to the acid, there was a
small residuum of acid gas. Having before
concluded (page 287) that muriatic acid gas
was of the specific gravity 1.61, I might have
adopted the ratio of acid and alkali in muriate
of ammonia to be 1.61 to .6 ; and hence have
inferred the quantity and volume of ammonia
in a given solution, from the quantity of mu-
riatic acid solution requisite to saturate it.
But there was one important circumstance
against this; the atom of muriatic acid I knew
weighed 22, and the ratio of 1.61 to .6, is the
same as 22 to 8.2 nearly ; hence, the weight
of an atom of ammonia must have been 8.2 or
4.1, which I was aware was inconsistent with
the previous determinations concerning azote
and hydrogen. Observing in the 2d vol. of
of the AMvmoires d’ Arcueil, that Biot and Gay
Lussac find the specific gravity of muriatic
acid gas to be so low as 1.278, and under-
standing from conversation with Mr. Davy,
that he also had found the specific gravity of
the gas to be considerably-less than I had con-
cluded, I was induced to repeat the experi-
ment of weighing it, taking every care to
avoid the introduction of liquid solution. I
sent a stream of acid gas, derived from com-
ton salt and concentrated sulphuric acid,

--- Page 448 ---
420 HYDROGEN WITH AZOTE.

through an intermediate vessel, into a dry flask
of common air, loosely corked, till it had ex-
pelled ths of the air, as appeared afterwards ;
the inside of the glass had a very slight opacity
on its surface; it had gained 1,', grain in
weight ; it was then uncorked and its mouth
plunged into water, when jths of the flask
were in a few moments occupied by the water.
Other trials gave similar results. The flask
held 6 grains of common air. Whence I de-
rive the specific gravity of muriatic acid gas to
be 1.23, and am induced to apprehend that
this is rather more than less than the truth.
The weights of equal volumes of muriatic acid
gas and ammoniacal gas will then be as 1.23
to .6; or as 22 to 11, nearly; and if we as-
sume that 11 measures of acid gas are sufficient
for 12 of alkaline, which is not unlikely from
experience ; then we shall have 22 parts acid
to 12 of ammonia for the constitution of mu-
riate of ammonia (exclusive of water), which
will make the theory and experience har-
monize ; according to this view, muriate of
ammonia must consist of 1 atom of muriatic
actd and 2 of ammonia, each atom of ammo-
nia being a compound of 1 atom of azote and
1 of hydrogen. However this may be, I find
that 22 parts of real muriatic acid, 38 of nitric,
and $4 of sulphuric, as determined by the re-

--- Page 449 ---
AMMONIA, 421

spective foregoing tables, will saturate equal
portions of any ammoniacal solution ; these,
then, may be consideréd as tests of the quan-
tity of real ammonia in different solutions ;
and if the ratio of 22 to 12, above adopted,
be incorrect, it cannot be greatly so; and the
error will be general, being so much per cent.
upon any table of ammoniacal solutions. The
test acids I prefer for use, are such as contain
half the quantities of acid above stated in 100
grain measures. Thus, 100 grain measures
of muriatic acid, sp. gravity 1.074, contain
11 grains of real acid ; 100 measures of nitric
acid, 1.141, contain 19 grains; and 100 mea-
sures of sulphuric acid, 1.135, contain 17
grains of real acid. Now, 100 measures of
ammoniacal solution of .97 sp. gravity, are
just sufficient to saturate these. Whence I
adopt that solution as test ammonia, and con-
clude that 100 grain measures of it contain 6
grains of real ammonia.

It will be perceived, then, that the accuracy
of the ensuing table depends upon several
points: namely, whether 100 measures of mu-
riatic acid of 1.074, really contain 11 grains
of acid ; whether the specific gravities of mu-
tiatic acid gas, and ammoniacal gas, are really
1.23 and .6, or in that ratio ; and whether 11
measures of acid gas saturate 12 measures of

--- Page 450 ---
422 HYDROGEN WITH AZOTE.

ammoniacal gas. I believe the errors in any
of these particulars to be very small, and pro-
bably they may be such as partly to correct
each other.

I find, after Mr. Davy, that a measure of
water being put toa measure of ammoniacal so-
lution, the two occupy two measures, without
any sensible condensation ; consequently, if the
quantity of ammonia in a measure of any given
specific gravity, as .90, be determined ; then
the quantity in a measure of .95, will be just half
as much: Hence, a table is easily constructed
for measures, and one for weights is derivable
without much calculation.

Qn the above table, it may be proper to re-
mark, that I have not had large quantities of
ammoniacal solution lower than .94, so as to
find their specific gravities experimentally ;
but have had small quantities to the amount of
10 or 20 grains of the several solutions from
26 to 12 per cent. ; I have no reason to suse
pect any material deviation from the law of
descent observed in the specific gravity down
to 12 per cent., when we go below that num-
ber ; at all events, it cannot be great down
to .85, and it is not of much importance, be-
cause solutions of that strength are never ob-
tained in the large way.—The second column,
exhibiting the grains of ammonia in 100 mea-
sures of the solution, is more convenient for
practice than the third, which gives the
weight in 100 grains of solution. The fourth
column, which shews the temperature at
whiclr the several solutions boil, will be found
highly interesting. The ebullition of a liquid
is well known to take place, when the steam
or vapour from it is of the same force as the
atmospheric pressure. In solutions down to
12 per cent., the experiments were performed
by inserting a thermometer into a phial con-
taining the solution, and plunging the phial
into hot water till the liquid boiled; but ia
the higher solutions a small portion, as 20

grains, was thrown up a tube filled with mer-
cury ; the tube was then put into a phial of
mercury, and the whole plunged into warm
water; the temperature was then ascertained
requisite to bring the mercury in the tube t~
the level of that in the phial. The fifth co-
lumn is calculated from the second, sup-
posing the specific gravity of ammoniacal gas
= 6.

It may be observed, that the above table
gives the quantity of ammonia in different so-
lutions, from 15 to 20 per cent. less than Mr.
Davy’s table ; also, that the common ammo-
niacal solutions of the shops usually contain
from 6 to 12 per cent. of ammonia.

Before we can estimate the value of the
fourth and fifth columns of the table, we must
ascertain the force of vapour from ammoniacal
solutions at different temperatures, If it be
found in some one instance, we may by ana-
Jogy infer the results in others. As the steam
from water varies in force in geometrical pro-
gression to equal increments of temperature,
it might be expected that the steam or gas
from liquid ammonia should do the same ; but
as the liquid is a compound, the simple law
of the force of aqueous steam does not obtain.
Tt appears, however, from the following re-
sults, that a near approximation to this law is

observed. Into a syphon barometer I threw
a quantity of .946 liquid ammonia, which
was by agitation, &c. transferred to the va-
cuum over the mercury. The vacuum was
then immersed successively in water of different
temperatures, and the force of the gas observed

Hence it seems, that the intervals of tempe-
rature required to double the force of ammo-
niacal steam, increase in ascending. I had
no doubt but this sort of steam or gas, would
mix with common air, without having its clas-
ticity affected, like as other steams do ; but L
ascertained the fact by experiment : Thus I
mixed a given volume of air with steam of 15
inches force, and found that the air was doubled
in bulk.

These facts are curious and important. They
shew that ammonia is not retained in water

--- Page 454 ---
426 HYDROGEN WITH AZOTE.

without external force, and that the pressure
of no elastic fluid avails but that of ammo-
niacal gas itself ; thus establishing the truth of
the general law which I have so much insisted
on, that xo elastic fluid is a sufficient barrier
against the passage of another elastic fluid.

We may now see upon what causes the
saturation of water with ammonia depends.
They are two ; the temperature of the liquid ;
end the pressure of the incumbent ammoniacal
gas, exclusive of the air intermixed with it.
For instance, if the temperature be given, 50°
(old scale); then the strongest possible solu-
tion, under atmospheric pressure, will be such,
that 100 measures will have the specific gravity
.87, and contain 26 grains of ammonia, or
419 times the volume of gas. But if, in satu-
rating the water by sending up gas, there be
common air, so as to make iths of the in-
cumbent gas, then the solution cannot be made
stronger than .946, of which 100 measures
contain 11 grains of ammonia, or 162 times
the volume of gas. I have obtained a satu-
rated solution containing 26 per cent, ammo-
nia, with ,{,th common air in the incumbent
gas; and at the same temperature, another
saturated solution, containing only 17 per cent.
ammonia, with 3ths common air in the in-
cumbent gas.

--- Page 455 ---
AMMONIA. 427

With respect to the constitution of ammonia,
Priestley, Scheele. and Bergman pointed out
the t-vo clements into which it is decomposed.
Berthollet first settled the proportions of the
elements, and the quantity of each obtained
from a given volume of ammoniacal gas. It
is highly to his credit too, that subsequent
Tepetitions of his experiments, under the im-
proved state of knowledge, have scarcely
amended his results. Priestley resolved 1 mea-
sure of ammoniacal gas, by electricity, into 3
measures of gas not absorbable by water ; but
his ammonia could not have been dry. Ber-
thollet resolved 17 measures into $3 in the
same way: this result has since been corro-
borated by various authors. He also found
that the gas so produced, was a mixture of 121
parts of azote by weight, with 29 of hydrogen;
or 4.7 azote with 1 of hydrogen.

In 1800, Mr. Davy published his researches,
in which were given several interesting results
onammonia, Mr. Davy decomposed ammo-
nia, by sending the gas through a red hot
poicelain tube ; after the common air was ex-
pelled, the collected gas was found free from
oxygen. To 140 measures of this gas were
added 120 of oxygen ; the mixture being ex-
ploded by electricity, 110 measures of gas were
left; and of course 150 were cenverted inte

428 MYDROGEN WITH AZOTE.

water; of this 100 measures must have been
hydrogen. Whence, 140 measures of the gas
from decompased ammonia, contained 100 hy-
drogen and 40 azote ; or 100 measures con-
tained 71.4 hydrogen and 28.6 azote. This
conclusion was so nearly agreeing with the
previous determination of Berthollet, that both
have justly been held up as specimens of the
accuracy of modern chemical analysis.

In 1808, Mr. Davy published his celebrated
discoveries relating to the decomposition of
the fixed alkalies. Having ascertained that
these contained oxygen, he was led by analogy
to suspect the same element inammonia. Se-
veral experiments were made, which seemed
to countenance this idea ; but these could not
be considered conclusive, as Jong as it was ad-
mitted that no oxygen appeared in the decom-
position of ammonia by electricity, and yet
that the weight of the azote and hydrogen
were together equal to that of the ammonia
decomposed. Mr. Davy re-examined the spe-
cific gravity of ammoniacal gas, the quantity
of gases evolved by the decomposition of a
given volume of it, and the ratio of azote to
hydrogen in the same. The result was, that
the gases obtained amounted only to +$ths of
the weight of the arhmonia ; the remaining
sth Mr, Davy thought must be oxygen,

--- Page 457 ---
AMMONIA. 429

which, uniting to hydrogen, formed a portion
of water, The way in which this ,th was
saved, was principally by diminishing the ab-
solute quantity of gases derived from a given
volume of ammonia, but partly by finding less
azote and more hydrogen than had been before
estimated. Thus, 100 measures of ammo-
niacal gas produced only 180 measures of
mixed gas, though commonly estimated at 200 ;
and this gas was found to consist of 26 azote
and 74 hydrogen per cent.

These conclusions, so different from what
had been long adopted, and depending upon
experiments of sme delicacy, were not likely
to be received without a more general scrutiny.
Dr, Henry in England, and A. B. Berthollet
in France, seem both to have renewed the
investigation into the component parts of am-
monia with great care and assiduity. Dr.
Hemy’s object was to determine whether any
oxygen, water, or any other compound con-
taining oxygen, could be detected in the ana-
lysis of ammonia ; this enquiry included the
two others; namely, the quantity of gases ob-
tained from a given volume of ammoniacal
gas, and the proportion of azure to hydrogen
inthe same. The results were, that neither
oxygen nor water could be fuund ; that for the
most part the bulk of ammonia was doubled

--- Page 458 ---
430 HYDROGEN WITH AZOTE.

by decomposition, even when the gas was
previously dried with extreme care ; and thar
the ratio of azote to hydrogen in the mixture,
from an average of six careful experiments,
was 274 to 723. In this last decision, Dr.
Henry was so fortunate as to discover a more
easy and expeditious mode of analysis than
had been known before ; he found that am-
moniacal gas mixed with a due proportion of
oxygen, of nitrous oxide, or even of nitrous
gas, would explode by an electric spark. He
found an under proportion of oxygen gas to
answer best (about 6 measures of oxygen to 10
of ammonia) : the explosion produced a com-
plete decomposition of the ammonia, and a
partial combustion of the hydrogen; after
which more oxygen was put to the residuum,
and the remainder of the hydrogen consumed.
From one experiment, in which 100 measures
of ammonia were decomposed in a tube of
which the mercury had been previously boiled,
Dr. Henry only obtained 181 measures of gas ;
and he seems to think that this experiment
may be the most correct in regard to that
object. (Philos. Trans, 1809).

In the Memoires d’Arcueil, tom. 2, M. A.
B. Berthollet has a paper on the analysis of
ammonia, He alludes to the experiments of
Berthollet in the memoirs of the academy.

1785; in which the ratio of 27.5 azote to 72.5
hydrogen, was found in the decomposed ami-
monia, allowing 196 hydrogen for 100 oxygen.
He reports several experiments and observa-
tions relative to the oxidation and deoxidation
of iron in ammoniacal gas. He then proceeds
to prove, that the weight of azote and hydro-
gen produced in the decomposition of am-
monia, is equal to the weight of the ammonia
itself. Biot and Arago determine the specific
gravities of azote, hydrogen, and ammonia,
to be .969, .073, and .597 respectively, which
A. B. Berthollet adopts. He finds that 100
measures of ammonia produce 205 of perma-
nent gas ; which, by analysis, gives 24.5 azote
and 75.5 hydrogen per cent, Like Dr. Henry,
A. B. Berthollet decomposed ammonia by ex-
ploding it with oxygen gas; but unfortunately
he used an excess of oxygen, and then aeter-
mined the residuary oxygen by the addition of
hydrogen : he was aware, however, that part
of the azote was thus converted into nitric
acid. Upon collecting the results, he makes
it appear, that the gases produced by the de-
composition of ammonia are, as nearly as pos-
sible, equal to the weight of the ammonia.
Though the experiments of these two au-
thors may be deemed satisfactory, with regard
to the non-existence of oxygen in ammonia,

they would have been more so if they had
accorded in the quantity of gas derived from a
given volume of ammonia, and in the ratio of
azote to hydrogen. Having made some expe-
riments myself on these heads, I may be al-
lowed to give my opinion as to the causes of
these differences.—I am persuaded, with Mr.
Davy, that ammonia is not doubled by decom-
position, when due care is taken to prevent
any liquid from adhering to the tube or mer-
cury; but at the same time am inclined to
believe, from experience, that 100 measures
of ammonia will give not less than 185 or 190
measures of gas by dscomposition: I took a
tube and filled it with dried mercury; then
transferred a portion of gas into it, and by
pushing a glass rod up the tube several times,
displaced the mercury in the tube, so that no
Tiquid ammonia could exist in the renovated
mercury. This gas, being decomposed by
electricity, produced after the rate of 187 for
100. With respect to the ratio of azote to
hydrogen, I am convinced it is to be obtained
only by decomposing the ammonia previously
to the combustion of the hydrogen, and this
may be done cither by electricity or by heat ;
in these cases, ammonia will be resolved into
28 measures of azotic gas, and 72 measures of
hydrogen gas, in the hundred. I have re-

--- Page 461 ---
AMMONIA, 433

peatedly obtained it so by electricity, the re-
sults never deviating farther than from 27 to
29 of azote. This agrees sufficiently with
Berthollet’s original analysis by electricity,
and with Davy’s analysis by heat in 1800;
both of them made without any theoretic
views as to quantity, which cannot be said of
any of the subsequent investigations on this
subject.

We are now to see how far these results
will agree with the specific gravity of ammo-
niacal gas: that is, whether the weights of the
two gases are equal to the weight of the am-
monia decomposed.

The excess of 3ths of a giain upon 60, is too
small to merit notice, and may arise from an
inaccuracy in any of the data, which, if cor-
rected, could have no material influence on the
conclusions.

I shall now make a few observations on the
other methods of analyzing ammonia. Dr.
Henry's methods of burning ammonia in
Volta’s eudiometer along with oxygenous gas,

nitrous gas, and nitrous oxide, unite elegance
with expedition, and when well understood,
cannot but be valuable. It appears to me,
however, both from experience and analogy,
that a compound combustible, such as am-
monia, is never decomposed and one of its
elements burnt, to the entire exclusion of the
other. Numerous instances may be found in
the compounds of charcoal and hydrogen, of
phosphorus and hydrogen, &c. where one of
the elements seizes the oxygen with more ra-
pidity than the other ; but some portion of the
other is always burnt. Even when the com-
bustible gases are only mixed together, and
not combined, we do not find that one of them
precludes the other from taking a share of the
oxygen tillit is saturated. Thus, in a mixture
of carbonic oxide with hydrogen, with a defi-
ciency of oxygen, part of both is burnt by an
electric spark. Dr. Henry has, indeed, no-
ticed that ammonia fired with excess of oxy-
gen, gives nitric avid as well as water. I have
reason to believe this is the case in some de-
gree, in whatever proportion they are fired,
I have seldom obtained so much as 27 per
cent. of azote by the combustion of ammonia
with oxygen (the hydrogen being estimated by
doubling the oxygen spent), and in no in-
stance 28: but it will be manifest that all the

--- Page 463 ---
AMMONIA. 435

oxygen is not consumed in ourning the hydro-
gen, if we note the ammoniacal gas expended,
and allow only 66 or 67 per cent. oxygen for
the hydrogen ; there will generally be found a
greater expence of oxygen, which must have
gone to form nitric acid. The combustion of
ammonia with nitrous gas usually gives from
25 to 27 per cent. of azote, allowing the con-
stitution of nitrous gas to be what is stated at
page 331. Upon the whole, | found nitrous
oxide to approximate nearest to the truth.
When 100 measures of ammonia are exploded
with 120 of nitrous oxide, the gases resulting
are azote with a very small portion of hydro-
gen; if to this a little hydrogen be added, and
then an excess of oxygen, another explosion
will determine the residuary hydrogen ; which
being deducted, there remain about 172 azote,
120 of which come irom the nitrous oxide,
and 52 from the ammonia, which gives after
the rate of 28 azote per cent. on the evolved
gases.—-When the decomposition of ammonia
is attempted by oxymuriatic acid gas, a gra-
duated tube is filled with the gas, and plunged
into liquid ammonia in this way, if we
reckon a measure of the acid gas to a measure
of hydrogen, we shall find the azote evolved
and left in the tube, amount to 23 or 24 per
cent. upon both gases. It is to be presumed,

--- Page 464 ---
436 HYDROGEN WITH AZOTE.

then, tha, oxymuriatic acid, like oxygen,
consumes part of both the elements of am-
monia.

By comparing the weight of azote with that
of hydrogen in the above table, we find them
as 4.7 to I nearly. This evidently marks the
constitution of ammonia to be that of t atom of
each of the elements combined. But we have
before determined the element of azote to
weigh 5.1, when treating of the compounds of
azote and oxygen. This difference is probably
to be ascribed to our having over-rated the
specific gravity of nitrous gas, and perhaps
nitrous oxide, In the Alemoires d'Arcueil, I
observe Bérard finds the specific gravity of ni-
trous gas to be 1.04, instead of 1.10, which
last I have made my calculations from ; if the
former should prove true, it will reduce my
valuation of azote in nitric acid nearly to 4.7 ;
Ihave not had an opportunity of ascertaining
the specific gravity of nitrous gas ; but am in-
clined to believe that 1.10 may be too high.
Berthollet finds nitrous oxide to be 1.36, in-
stead of 1.61; I much suspect the former is too
low.

Upon the whole, we may conclude that an
atom of ammonia is constituted of 1 atom of
hydrogen and 1 of azote, and weighs nearly 6.
The diameter of the elastic particle is .909,

--- Page 465 ---
OLEFIANT GAS. 437

that of hydrogen being 1. Or, 300 measures
of ammoniacal gas contain as many atoms as
400 measures of hydrogen, or as 200 of
oxygen.

SECTION 7.

HYDROGEN WITH CARBONE.

There are two combinations of hydrogen
with carbone, now well known, easily dis-
tinguishable from each other and from all other
combinations. They are both elastic fluids ;
one of them, called olefiant gas, is a compound
of 1 atom of hydrogen and 1 of carbone ; the
other, which I call carburetted hydrogen, is
a compound of 2 atoms of hydrogen and 1
of carbone, as will be manifest from what
follows.

1. Olefiant Gas.

The gas denominated olefiant, was disco-
vered and examined by the Dutch chemists,
Bondt, Dieman, &c. and a memoir on the sub-
ject was published in the 45th vol. of the Jour-
nal de Physique, 179+.

--- Page 466 ---
438 HYDROGEN WITH CARBONE.

Olefiant gas may be procured by mixing 2
measures of sulphuric acid with 1 measure of
alcohal ; this mixture in a gas bottle must be
heated to about 300° by a lamp, when the
liquid exhibits the appearance of ebullition,
and the gas comes over: it should be passed
through water, to absorb any sulphurous acid
which may be generated.

This gas is unfit for respiration, and extin-
guishes flame, but it is highly combustible :
its specific gravity, according to the Dutch
chemists, is .905; according to Dr. Henry,
-967. Perhaps .95 is about the truth. Water
absorbs 7th of its bulk of this gas; or the atoms
of gas in the water are just twice the distance
they are without ; and it may be expelled
again by the othe~ gases. This property (of
being absorbed by’8 times its bulk of water)
occurred to me in 1804, in a course of expe-
riments on the absorption of gases by water.
It is peculiar to this gas, and consequently
distinguishes it from all others. When olefiant
gas is mixed with oxymuriatic acid gas, a di-
minution takes place, like as when oxygen
and nitrous gas are mixed ; but the result is
an oil, which swims on the surface of the
water. Hence the Dutch chemists gave this
gas the name of olefant. For this purpose,
they found 3 measures of olefiant gas required

--- Page 467 ---
OLEFIANT GAS. 439

4 measures of the acid gas; but Dr. Henry
finds 5 of olefiant require 6 of the acid. The
difference is not great, considering the diffi-
culty of the experiment. As neither of these
results will agree with the other known pro-
perties of these two gases, I suspected that
both would be found in some degree incorrect 5
which proved to be the case from the follow-
ing experiments. Having taken two similar
tubes graduated, containing each about 170
grains of water, I filled them, one immediately
after the other, from a bottle generating oxy-
muriatic acid copiously ; into one of these,
200 measures of olefiant gas were slowly trans-
ferred ; after standing some time, the residuary
gas was transferred:and noted ; then the other
tube with acid gas was taken, the gas passed
5 or 6 times through water, till no further di-
minution was observed, and the residuary gas
was noted and allowed for impurity in the first
tube. By this procedure no acid gas was lost,
and an excess of olefiant gas being used, the
purity of this last did not enter into the calcu-
lation. In one trial, 165 measures of oxymu-
riatic acid gas condensed 168 of olefiant gas ;
in another, 165 took 167. From these, I
conclude that oxymuriatic acid requires a very
little more than its bulk of olefiant gas to be
saturated: perhaps 100 of the former may take

--- Page 468 ---
440 HYDROGEN WITH CARBONE,

102 measures of the latter ; but if we reckon
equal volumes, the error cannot in general be
material.

Olefiant gas burns with a dense, white
flame. It explodes with uncommon violence
when mixed with oxygen and electrified ; the
products resulting are various, according to the
circumstances. When completely saturated
with oxygen, the results are, according to

carb, ackd.
Berthollet, 100 measures take 280 oxygen, produce 180
Dr. Henry,100 — — 24 — — 179

The rest of the produce is water. These
results, agreeing so well with each other, are
the more plausible ; but | can add that my
own experience corroborates them, particu-
larly in regard to oxygen: My results have
always given Icssthan $00, but more than 270;
the acid, I apprehend, should be about 185
or 190: unless a great excess of oxygen be
used, the charcoal is partly thrown down, and it
makes the gas turbid after the explosion ; the
result in this case affords less carbouic acid
than is due.

When olefiant gas atone is subjected to con-
tinued electricity, cither over mercury or wa-
ter, the result is hydrogen gas, and a quantity
of charcoal is deposited. A very careful ex-
periment of this kind was made by Dr, Henry

--- Page 469 ---
OLEFIANT GAS. 44)

and myself, in which 42 measures of pure
olefiant gas were electrified till they became
82; these were exploded with oxygen, and
found to consist of 78 hydrogen, and 2 ole-
fiant gas. Ilere 40 olefiant became 78 hy-
drogen, or very near double. The charcoal
was thrown down. According to this, 100
measures of olefiant gas will contain 195 of
hydrogen ; which require 98 oxygen for their
combustion ; now as the charcoal must take
the rest, or nearly 196 measures, it follows that
in the combustion of olcfiant gas, 2 parts of
the oxygen are spent upon the charcoal, and 1
part upon the hydrogen. Hence we obtain
this conclusion, that an atom of olefiant gas
consists of 1 of charcoal and 1 of hydrogen
united. No oxygen can be present in olefiant
gas ; because during the elec‘rification it would
be detected, either in the form of water or
carbonic oxide.

It will be proper now to see how far the
weights of the gases entering into combination,
agree with the previous determinations. An
atom of charcoal weighs 3.4 (see page 382),
and 1 of hydrogen weighs 1, together making
an atom of olefiant gas, 6.4. This atom will
require 3 of oxygen for its combustion ;
namely, 2 for the charcoal, to form carbonic
acid, and 1 for the hydrogen, to form water ;

--- Page 470 ---
+42 HYDROGEN WITH CARBONE.

these 3 weigh 21; whence 6.4 parts of olefiant
gas by weight, should take 21 of oxygen.
Now supposing, according to Dr. Henry’s re-
sult, that 100 measures of olefiant gas require
284 for their combustion ; and further, that
the specific gravity of oxygenous gas is 1.10
(agreeably to Allen and Pepys, as also Biot
and Arago), we shal] have 284 X 1.1 = 312.4,
the weight of the oxygen; hence, if 21 : 6.4: :
312.4: 95, the weight of 100 measures of
olefiant gas, corresponding to a specific gravity
of 95. lence, then, it appears that the
weight of the gases combined, perfectly corro-
borates the above conclusions respecting the
constitution of olefiant gas.

There are some remarkable circumstances
attending the combustion of olefiant gas in
Volta’s eudiometer, which deserve notice as
part of the history of the gas, but particularly
as they put the constitution of the gas beyond
all doubt. If 100 measures of oxygen be put
to 100 of olefiant gas, and electrified, an ex-
plosion ensues, not very violent ; but instead
of a diminution, as usual, there is a great
increase of gas; instead of 200 measures, there
will be found about 360 ; some traces of car-
bonic acid are commonly observed, which dis-
appear on passing two or three times through
lime water ; there will then remain, perhaps,

--- Page 471 ---
OLEFIANT GAS, 443

$50 measures of permanent gas, which is all
combustible, yielding by an additional dose of
oxygen, carbonic acid and water, the same as
if entirely burnt in the first instance. What,
therefore, is this new gas in the intermediate
state? The answer is clear. It is carbonic
oxide and hydrogen mixed together, an equal
number of atoms of each. One third of the
oxygen requisite for the complete combustion,
suffices to convert the carbone into carbonic
oxide, and the hydrogen at the instant is li-
berated ; hence the other two thirds are em-
ployed, the one to convert the carbonic oxide
into acid, the other to convert the hydrogen
into water. In fact, the 350 measures consist
of nearly 170 of each gas, which together re-
quire nearly 170 of oxygen for their com-
bustion,*

* M. Berthollet contends, that all the combustible gases
into which carbone and hydrogen enter, contain also oxy-
gen: he calls them oxycarburetted hydrogen. Mr. Murray
also enters into his views in this respect.—<As far as relates
to olefiant gas, it will be time enough for animadversion
‘on this opinion, when the accuracy of the above: facts and
observations are questioned. But there is one circumstance
which M. Berthollet bas not explained in regard to this
gas, and it turns upon a point which he and I acknowledge,
but which is not perhaps generally received; namely, that
when to gases unite to form a third, this last is specifically
heavier than the lighter of the two. Now, in the above

--- Page 472 ---
444 HYDROGEN WITH CARBONE.

The diameter of an atom of olefiant gas is
-81 to hydrogen J. And 109 measures of it
contain as many atoms as 188 of hydrogen, or
as 94 of oxygen, or (probably) as 200 of oxy-
muriatic acid ; whence the union of this Jast
with olefiant gas, must be 2 atoms of the gas
with 1 of the acid.

2. Carburetied Hydrogen.

The gas which I denominate carburetted
hydrogen, was known in a state of mixture,
to Dr. Priestley ; he called all such mixtures
by the name of heavy inflammable air, La-
voisier, Higgins, Austin, Cruickshanks, Ber-
thollet, Henry and others, have since culti-
vated this department of science.—Cruick-
shanks contributed much to unveil the subject,
by pointing out carbonic oxide as an inflam-
mable gas, sud generis, but often found mixed
with other gases. No correct notion of the
constitution of the gas about to be described,
seems to have becn formed till the atomic

instance, we find olefiant gas and oxygenous gas, uniting
to form a third (according to his opinion), which is lighter
by one half nearly than the lighter of the two, How is
this new oxycarburetted hydrogen to be reconciled with
the above principle ?

--- Page 473 ---
CARBURETTED HYDROGEN, 445

theory was introduced and applied in the in-
vestigation. It was in the summer of 1804,
that I collected at various times, and in various
places, the inflammable gas obtained from
ponds; this gas I found always contained some
traces of carbonic acid and a portion of azote 5
but that when cleared of these, it was of a
uniform constitution. After due examination,
I was convinced that just one half of the oxy-
gen expended in its combustion, in Volta’s
eudiometer, was applied to the hydrogen, and
the other half to the charcoal. This leading
fact afforded a clue to its constitution.
Carburetted hydrogen gas may be obtained
in a pure state, with the above exceptions,
from certain ponds in warm weather. Clayey
ponds, in the vicinity of a town, where soot
and other carbonaccous matter is deposited,
abound with this gas. The bottom of the
pond being stirred with a stick, large bubbles
ascend, which may be caught by filling a
tumbler with water, and inverting it over the
ascending bubbles. This gas is obtained nearly
pure also by distilling pitcoal with a moderate
red heat. It is now largely used asa substitute
for lamps and candies, under the name of coal
gas. According to Dr. Henry’s analysis, coal
gas does not usually contain more than 4 or 5
per cent. of carbonic acid, sulphuretted hydro-

--- Page 474 ---
416 HYDROGEN WITH CARBONE.

gen, and olefiant gas. The rest is principally
carburetted hydrogen, but mixed with some
atoms of carbonic oxide and hydrogen. The
last portion of gas driven off from pit-coal,
seems to be entirely carbonic oxide and hydro-
gen. The distillation of wood and of moist
charcoal, and many other vegetable substances,
produces carburetted hydrogen, but highly
charged with carbonic acid, carbonic oxide
and hydrogen ; the two last gases always appear
exclusively at the end of the process.

The properties of carburetted hydrogen are,
1. It is unfit for respiration, and for the sup-
port of combustion. 2. Its specific gravity
when pure, from my experience is very near
.6. Dr. Henry finds the coal gas to vary from
.6 to .78; but then the heaviest contain 15
per cent. of the heavy gases, carbonic acid,
sulphuretted hydrogen, and olefiant gas.—
Water absorbs ,!,th of its bulk of this gas.—If
100 measures of carburetted hydrogen be
mixed with 100 measures of oxygen (the least
that can be used with effect), and a spark
passed through the mixture, there is an ex-
plosion, without any material change of vo-
lume: after passing a few times through lime
water, it is reduced a little, manifesting signs
of carbonic acid. This residue is found to
possess all the characters of a mixture of equal

--- Page 475 ---
CARBURETTED HYDRCSEN. 447

volumes of carbonic oxide and hydrogen.
Upon adding 100 measures of oxygen to this
residue and passing a spark, nearly 100 mea-
sures of carbonic acid are produced, and the
rest of the produce is water. If 100 measures
of carburetted hydrogen be put to upwards of
200 of oxygen, and. fired over mercury, the
result will be a diminution of near 200 mea-
sures, and the residuary 100 measures will be
found to be carbonic acid.

Though carburetted hydrogen is naturally
produced in many coal mines, and occasionally
mixing with common air, exhibits some dread-
ful explosions in the large way; yet when
mixed with common air, in Volta’s eudio-
meter, it does not explode by a spark, unless
the gas be to the air, as 1 to 10 nearly, and
then feebly.

When a portion of carburetted hydrogen gas
is electrified for some time, it increases in
volume, in the end almost exactly doubling
itself ; at the same time a quantity of charcoal
is deposited. The whole of the gas is then
found to be pure hydrogen.

All these facts being compared, there can-
not remain the least doubt as to the constitution
of carbutetted hydrogen, It is a compound
of one atom of charcoal and two of hydrogen ;
the compound atom occupies the same space

--- Page 476 ---
448 HYDROGEN WITH CARBONE,

(nearly) as an atom of hydrogen ; and 4 atoms
of oxygen are necessary to its complete com-
bustion ; namely, 2 for the charcoal to form
carbonic acid, and 2 for the hydrogen to form
water. This conclusion derives a very clegant
confirmation, from the facts observed by cx-
ploding the gas with one half of the oxygen
requisite for complete combustion. In this
case, each atom of the gas requires only 3
atoms of oxygens the one joins to one of hy-
drogen and forms water ; the other joins to
the carbone to form carbonic oxide, at the
same moment the remaining atom of hydrogen
springs off. Thus there becomes 100 measures
of carbonic oxide and 100 of hydrogen, or the
same buik as the original mixture.

As the weight of an atom of charcoal is 5.4,
and 2 atoms of hydrogen are 2, the compound
atom weighs 7.4; but as there are the same
number of atoms of hydrogen and of carbu-
retted hydrogen in the same volume, 7.4 repre-
sents the number of times that carburetted
hydrogen is heavier than hydrogen. Now, the
weight of common air is about 12 times as
great as hydrogen; therefore, the relative
weights or specific gravities of the two gases,
are as 7.4to 12, or as .6 to 1, nearly, which
agrees with experience ; hence we derive this
conclusion, that carburetted hydrogen consists

--- Page 477 ---
CARBURETTED HYDROGEN. 449

entirely of hydrogen and carbone, the whole
weight of the gas being accounted for in the
carbonic acid and water formed by its com-
bustion.*

I think it proper to observe, that, according
to my most careful experiments, 100 measures
of this gas require rather more than 200 mea-

,* According to M. Berthollet (Mem. d’Arcueil, tome 2d)
the gas from charcoal is a triple compound of carbone,
oxygen, and hydrogen. Whatever our speculative che-
mists may believe, no practical chemist in Britain adopts
this idea. That it always contains more or less of oxygen
no one disputes ; but then the oxygen is united solely to
the carbone forming carbonic oxide. The rest of the mix-
ture consists of carburetted hydrogen and hydrogen, I
sever find any difficulty in ascertaining the relative quane
tities of eactr of the gases in such mixtures. For instance,
suppose we take the first of Berthollet’s nine specimens.

Here it appears, that 20 measures of carb, hyd. + 34

measures of the sp. grav. .476, which being burned, take
81 oxygen, and give 53 carb. acid. Hence this mixture

sures of oxygen, and give rather more than
100 carbonic acid; but the difference is not
more than 5 per cent. and may in general be
neglected.—ITence, then, we may conclude
that the diameter of an atom of carburetted
hydrogen is nearly equal to that of hydrogen,
but rather less.

SECTION 8.
HYDROGEN WITH SULPHUR.

There are two compounds of hydrogen with
sulphur ; the one, a well known elastic fluid
denominated sulphuretted hydrogen, the other
a viscid, oily compound, called supersulphu-
retted hydrogen. The former of these consists
of 1 atom of each element,* the the latter pro-
bably of 1 atom of hydrogen united to 2 of
sulphur.

1, Sulphuretied Hydrogen.

The best way I have found to obtain sul-
phuretted hydrogen in a pure state, is to heat
a piece of iron to a white or welding heat ina

* The figure for sulphuretted hydrogen, plate 4, part 1,

SULPHURETTED HYDROGEN, 451

smith’s forge, then suddenly drawing it from
the fire, apply a roll of sulphur ; the two being
rubbed together, unite and run down in a
liquid form, which soon fixes and becomes
brittle. This compound or sulphuret of iron,
is to be granulated and put into a gas bottle,
to which dilute sulphuric acid is to be added,
after which the gas comes over plentifully.
When the sulphuret of iron is made in a cru-
cible from iron filings and sulphur, it seldom
answers well; it often gives hydrogen mixed
with the sulphuretted hydrogen. The reason
seems to be, that several sulphurets of iron
exist; namely, the first, the second, the third,
&c. and it is the second only, or that which is
constituted of 1 atom of iron and 2 of sulphur,
formed in the process above described, which
is essential to the formation of sulphuretted hy-
drogen. The others either give hydrogen or
no gas at all.

Sulphuretted hydrogen is unfit for respiration
and for supporting combustion: it has a disa-
gteeable smell, resembling that of rotten eggs;
its specific gravity is 1.10 according to Kirwan,
and 1.23 according to Thenard. Mr. Davy,
LT understand, makes it about 1.13. Some trials
of mine a few years since, gave a result near
Thenard’s ; but till a more correct one can be
obtained, we may adopt the mean 1.16. Wa-

ter absorbs just its bulk of this gas; whert,
therefore, it is mixed with hydrogen, this last
will be left after washing in water, or what
is still better, in lime water. Sulphure'ted
hydrogen burns with a blue flame. When
mixed with oxygen, in the ratio of 100 mea-
sures to 50 of oxygen (which is the least ef-
fective quantity), it explodes by an electric
spark ; water is produced, sulphur is depo-
sited, and the gases disappear. If 150 or more
measures of oxygen are used, then after the
explosion over mercury, about 87 measures of
sulphurous acid are found in the tuhe, and
150 of oxygen disappear, or enter into com-
bination with both the elements of the gas.

From the experiments of Austin, Henry,
&c. it has been established, that sulphuretted
hydrogen undergoes no change of volume by
electrification, but deposits sulphur. I have
repeated these experiments, and have not
been able to ascertain whether there was in-
crease or diminution. The residue of gas is
pure hydrogen.

From these facts, the constitution of sul-
phuretted hydrogen is clearly pointed out. It
is 1 atom of sulphur and 1 of hydrogen, united
in the same volume as 1 of pure hydrogen.
When burned, 2 atoms of oxygen unite to 1
of sulphur to form sulphurous acid, and 1 of

--- Page 481 ---
SUPERSULPHURETTED HYDROGEN. 453

oxygen to 1 of hydrogen to form water. The
weights of the elements confirm this consti-
tution. One atom of sulphur has been found
to weigh 13 (see page 393), to which adding
1 for hydrogen, we obtain the weight of an
atom of sulphuretted hydrogen = 14; this
number likewise expresses the number of times
that sulphuretted hydrogen should exceed hy-
drogen in specific gravity. But common air
exceeds hydrogen 12 times; therefore, 12:
142: specific gravity of common air : sp. gra-
vify of sulphuretted hydrogen = 1.16, agree-
ably to the preceding determination. Hence
this gas is wholly composed of sulphur and
hydrogen, as above.

Sulphuretted hydrogen unites, like the acids,
to alkalies, earths, and metallic oxides, form-
ing with them salts of definite proportions,
which are called hydrosulphurets Some of
these are important chemical agents; but they
are apt to undergo changes by keeping, espe-
cially in solution.

2. Supersulphuretted Hydrogen.

This compound may be obtained as follows :
Let half an ounce of flower of sulphur and as
much hydrate of lime, be gently boiled toge-
ther in a quart of rain water for one hour;

--- Page 482 ---
454, HYDROGEN WITH SULPHUR,

more water may be added as it evaporates.
After cooling, a clear yellow liquid is ob-
tained, which is a solution of sulphuret of
lime: it will vary in specific gravity from 1.01
to 1.02, according to circumstances.—To 6
ounces of this liquid put half an ounce of mu-
riatic acid, and stir the mixture. In a short
time, the mixture exhibits a milky appearance,
and this becomes interspersed with brown oily
dots, which gradually subside into an adhesive
mass of a semiliquid form at the bottom. The
liquid may then be poured off, and the brown
mass washed with water, which is to be
poured off. From 20 to 40 grains of this brown
oily substance will be obtained ; it is super-
sulphuretted hydrogen.

Scheele, Berthollet, and Proust, have made
observations on this compound. When ex-
posed to the air, or even in water, it exhales
sulphuretted hydrogen, especially if warm.
On account of its viscidity and adhesiveness,
it is very difficult to subject it to experience.
If a portion of it touch the skin, &c. it requires
a knife to scrape it off. It may be poured
from one vessel to another by means of water,
which prevents its adhering to the vessel.
When a little of it is appplied to the tongue, a
sensation of great heat, and a bitter taste are
felt; the saliva becomes white like milk..

--- Page 483 ---
SUPERSULPHURETTED HYDROGEN. 455

When liquid alkali is poured upon supersul-
phuretted hydrogen, heat is produced, hydro-
sulphuret is formed, and sulphur precipitated.
—These facts have all been observed by me;
though few if any of them are new.

There is no doubt this substance is formed
of sulphur and hydrogen. I took 30 grains,
and exposed them to a moderate heat in a
glass capsule, over a candle, till they ceased to
exhale sulphuretted hydrogen. The residuum
weighed 21 grains; it was soft like clay ;
when ignited, it burned away with a blue
flame, and left no sensible residuum. When
it is considered, that supersulphuretted hy-
drogen is from tne moment of its formation
exhaling sulphuretted hydrogen, we cannot
wonder that a portion of it should give less
than half its weight of this gas. But scarcely
any doubt can be raised that the sulphur of
the gas is originally equal to that left behind ;
or that supersulphuretted hydrogen is consti-
tuted of 2 atoms of sulphur and } of hydrogen,
and consequently weighs 27 times as much as
hydrogen.

Though it is not our present business to ex-
plain the previous precess by which the article
under discussion is obtained ; yet, as it will be
some time before it comes regularly in our
way, it may perhaps be allowable. Hydrate

--- Page 484 ---
456 HYDROGEN WITH PHOSPHORUS,

of lime, is 1 atom of lime and 1 of water
united ; when boiled with sulphur as above,
it takes 3 atoms of sulphur. The compound
is sulphuret of hydrate of lime. When mu-
riatic acid is mixed with it, the acid seizes the
lime. The 3 atoms of sulphur divide the atom
of water in such sort, that two of them take the
hydrogen to form supersulphuretted hydrogen,
and one takes the oxygen to form sulphurous
oxide. This last occasions the milkiness of
the liquid ; by long digestion the milkiness
vanishes ; the sulphurous oxide is changed into
sulphuric acid and sulphur, which last falls
down, and forms nearly one fourth of that
which originally existed in the sulphuret.

SECTION 9,

HYDROGEN WITH PHOSPHORUS.

There is only one combination of hydrogen
with phosphorus yet known ; it isa gas deno-
minated phosphurelled hydrogen. This gas
may be procured as follows : Let an ounce or
two of hydrate of lime (dry slacked lime) be
put into a gas bottle or retort, and then a few
small pieces of phosphorus, amounting to 40
or 50 grains. If the materials are sufficient ta

--- Page 485 ---
PHOSPHURETTED HYDROGEN. 457

fill the bottle, no precaution need be used;
but if not, the bottle or retort should be pre-
viously filled with azotic gas, or some gas not
containing oxygen, in order to prevent an ex-
plosion. ‘The heat of a lamp is then to be ap-
plied, anda gas comes which may be received
over water. This gas is phosphuretted hy-
drogen ; but sometimes mixed with hydrogen.
—Liquid caustic potash may be used instead
of hydrate of lime, in order to prevent, the ge-
neration of hydrogen.

Phosphuretted hydrogen gas has the fol-
lowing properties: 1. When bubbles of it
come into the atmosphere, they instantly take
fire ; an explosion is produced, and a ring of
white smoke ascends, which is phosphoric
acid: 2. It is unfit for respiration, and for
supporting combustion : 3. Its specific gravity
is .85, common air being denoted by unity :
4, Water absorbs -;th of its bulk of this gas:
5. If the gas be electrified, the phosphorus is
thrown down, and there finally remains the
bulk of the gas of pure hydrogen. In fact,
the phosphorus is easily thrown down, either
by electricity, by heat, or by being exposed
to a large surface of water. In this respect,
phosphurctted hydrogen is nearly related to
sulphuretted hydrogen.

Though phosphuretted hydrogen explodes

--- Page 486 ---
458 HYDROGEN WITH PHOSPHORUS.

when sent into the atmosphere in bubbles, yet
if sent into a tube of three tenths of an inch
diameter, it may be mixed with pure oxygen,
without any explosion, In all the experiments
Thave made, which are more than 20, I never
had an instance of a spontaneous explosion.
In this case, an electric spark produces a most
vivid light, with an explosion not very vio-
Jent ; phosphoric or phosphorous acid and wa-
ter are produced.

My experiments on the combustion of this
gas give the following results: When 100
measures of pure phosphuretted hydrogen are
mixed with 150 of oxygen, and exploded, the
whole of both gases disappears ; water and
phosphoric acid are formed ; when 100 mea-
sures of the gas are mixed with 100 oxygen,
and fired, the whole of both gases still disap-
pears; in this case, water and phosphorous
acid are formed; when 100 measures are
mixed with less than 100 of oxygen, phos-
phorous acid and water are formed, but part of
the combustible gas remains unburnt.

As this gas is liable to be contaminated with
hydrogen, sometimes largely, on account of
the facility it possesses of depositing phos-
phorus, it is expedient to ascertain the exact
proportion of phosphuretted hydrogen to’ hy-
drogen in any proposed mixture. This I find

--- Page 487 ---
PHOSPHURETTED HYDROGEN. 459

may easily be done. Whenever a sufficient
quantity of oxygen is afforded, the whole of
the combustible gas is consumed : The exact
volume of oxygen and its purity must be
noted ; the quantity of oxygen in the residue
must also be noted. Then the total dimi-
nution after the explosion, being diminished
by the oxygen consumed, leaves the combus-
tible gas. Now, as phosphuretted hydrogen
takes. 14 times its bulk of oxygen, and hydro-
gen takes + its bulk of oxygen ; we shall ob-
tain the following equations, if P denote the
volume of phosphuretted hydrogen, H that of
hydrogen, O that of oxygen, andS=P+H,
the whole of the combustible gas.
P= O-1318
H=us—o

From these equations, the ratio of the two
gases in any mixture is deduced. The ana-
lysis may be corroborated as follows: Fo any
mixture containing a certain volume of phos-
phuretted hydrogen, let the same volume ot
oxygen be added; after the explosion, the
diminution. will be just twice the volume of
oxygen. In this case, the phosphuretted hy-
drogen is preferred by the oxygen; phos-
phorous acid, and water are formed, and the
hydrogen remains in the tube. If more oxy-

--- Page 488 ---
460 HYDROGEN WITH PHOSPHORUS,

gen is put than the phosphuretted hydrogen,
then the diminution after firing is more than
twice the oxygen.

The investigation respecting the proportion
of hydrogen mixed with phosphuretted hy-
drogen, was instituted chiefly in consequence
of a difference of opinion respecting the spe-
cific gravity of the latter gas. I had found
100 cubic inches to weigh about 26 grains ;
Mr. Davy informed me he had found 100
inches to weigh only 10 grains: the difference
is enormous. I requested Dr. Henry would
assist me in repeating the experiment. We
obtained a gas, such that 100 inches weighed
14 grains; this result surprized me; but upon
burning the gas with oxygen, it was found
only to take its bulk of that gas, and conse-
quently to be half hydrogen and half phos-
phuretted hydrogen, which satisfactorily ex-
plained the difficulty. Mr. Davy’s gas, I
conceive, must have been + phosphuretted hy-
drogen and } hydrogen, at the time it was
weighed ; however this may be, it is evident,
from what is related above, that nothing certain
can he inferred relative to the specific gravity
of this gas, unless a portion of the gas be ana-
lyzed previously to its being weighed ; a cir-
cumstance of which J was not at first suffici-
cently aware.

--- Page 489 ---
PHOSPHURETTED HYDROGEN. 461

Thave recently procured some phosphuretted
hydrogen gas from caustic potash and phos-
phorus ; an accident prevented me obtaining
a sufficient quantity to weigh; but I got 5 or
6 cubic inches, which of course were mixed
with the azotic gas previously put into the
retort. The pure combustible gas was of
such character, that 100 measures required
only 85 of oxygen for their combustion ; it
was consequently 35 phosphuretted hydrogen
and 65 hydrogen per cent. and probably
would have weighed afte: the rate of 10 or
11 grains for 100 cubic inches. I expected
much purer gas.

As to the constitution of phosphuretted hy-
drogen, it is clearly 1 atom of phosphorus
united to 1 of hydrogen, occupying the same
space as 1 of elastic hydrogen. In combustion,
the atom of hydrogen requires one of oxygen,
and the atom of phosphorus requires one or
two of oxygen, according as we intend to
produce phosphorous or phosphoric acid.
Hence it is that 100 measures of phosphu-
retted hydrogen require 50 oxygen to burn the
hydrogen, 50 more of oxygen to form phos-
phorous acid, and 50 more to form phosphoric
acid. The weight of the gas corroborates this
conclusion : it has been seen that the atom of
phosphorus weighs nearly 9 (page 415); this

--- Page 490 ---
462 CARBONE WITH SULPHUR, &c.

would make the specific gravity of phosphu-
retted hydrogen equal to 10 times that of hy-
drogen, which it actually is, or nearly so, from
the foregoing experiments.

a

The next compounds to be considered in
course, would be those of azote with carbone,
with sulphur, and with phosphorus ; but such
compounds either cannot be formed, or they
are yet unknown.

SECTION 10.

CARBONE WITH SULPHUR, WITH
PHOSPHORUS, AND SULPHUR WITH
PHOSPHORUS.

1. Carbone with Sulphur.

In the 42d vol. of the An. de Chimie, page
136, Clement and Desormes have announced
a combination of carbone and sulphur, which
they call carburetted sulphur. They obtain it
by sending the vapour of sulphur over red hot
charcoal ; it is collected in water in the form
of an oily liquid of the specific gravity 3.3.
This liquid is volatile, like ether, expanding
any gas into which itis admitted, and forming

--- Page 491 ---
CARBURETTED SULPHUR, 463

a permanent elastic fluid over the mercury of
abarometer. No gas is produced at the same
time as the liquid. When too much sulphur is
driven through, instead of a liquid, a solid
compound is formed which crystallizes in the
tube. They seem to have shewn that the
compound does not contain sulphuretted hy-
drogen.—In the 64th vol. of the Journal de
Physique, A. B. Berthollet endeavours to prove
that the liquid in question is a compound of
hydrogen and sulphur, and contains no char-
coal. The facts adduced are not sufficient to
decide the question either way. I should be
unwilling to admit, with Clement and De-
sormes, that the two inelastic elements, char-
coal and sulphur, would form an elastic or vo-
latile compound ; yet, they have rendered it
highly probable that charcoal makes a part of
the compound, as it disappears during the
process. I think it most probable, that Ber-
thollet is correct in the idea that this liquid
contains hydrogen. We know of no other
volatile liquid that does not contain hydrogen.
Perhaps it will be found a triple compound of
hydrogen, sulphur, and charcoal.

--- Page 492 ---
464 CARBONE WITH SULPHUR, &c.

2. Carbone with Phosphorus.

A combination of carbone and pnosphorus
has been pointed out by Proust, in the 49th
volume of the Journal de Physique, which he
names phosphuret of carbone. It is the reddish
substance which remains when new made
phosphorus is strained through leather in warm
water. The proportion of the two elements
has not been ascertained.

3. Sulphur with Phosphorus.

Melted phosphorus dissolves and combines
with sulphur, and that in various proportions,
which have not yet been accurately ascer-
tained. The compounds may be denominated
sulphurets of phosphorus. The method of
forming these compounds, is to melt a given
weight of phosphorus in a tube nearly filled
with water, and then to add small pieces of
sulphur, keeping the tube in hot water, taking
care not to exceed 160°, or 170°, or 180°, be-
cause the new compound begins to decompose
water rapidly at those high temperatures.
Pelletier has given us some facts towards a
theory of these various combinations, in the

--- Page 493 ---
SULPHURETTED PHOSPHORUS, 465

4th vol. of the An. de Chimie. He found
that a mixture of sulphur and phosphorus re-
mained fluid at a much lower temperature
than either of them individually ; and that
different proportions gave different fusing or
congealing points. One part of phosphorus,
combined with jth of sulphur, congealed at
77°; one part with 4, at 59°; one part with 4,
at 50°; one part with 1, at 41°; one part with
2, at 54°; but a certain portion was fluid,
and the rest solid; and one part with $, at
99515.

One would be apt to think, from these ex-
periments, that sulphur and phosphorus might
be combined in all proportions ; but the ob-
servation on the 5th led me to suspect that it
might have been applied to some others if the
results had been carefully noted.—I mixed 18}
grains of phosphorus and 13 of sulphur in a
graduated tube, put in water, and immersed
the whole into water of 160°. The phos-
phorus having been rendered fluid as usual, at
100°, gradually reduced the sulphur, till the
whole assumed a liquid form of the specific
gravity 1.44, It remained uniformly fluid at
45°, but was wholly congealed at 42. Here
were two atoms of phosphorus united to one of
sulphur. I then added 6t grains of sulphur,
making the mixture 18+ phosphorus, and 194

--- Page 494 ---
466 CARBONE WITH SULPHUR, &c,

salphur; this‘new mixture was reduced to uni-
form fluidity at 170°, and was of 1.47 specific
gravity; reduced to 47°, one part was fluid
and the other solid, the latter being at the
bottom of the tube. This solid part was not
completely reduced to fluidity in the tempe-
rature 100°. This seems to indicate that two
distinct combinations took place; the one,
two atoms of phosphorus and one of sulphur,
liquid at 47°; the other, one atom of phos-
phorus and one of sulphur, solid under 100°,
I next added 6} grains more of sulphur, mak-
ing in the whole 18; phosphorus and 26 sul-
phur, consequently in such proportion as to
afford a union of one atom of each; the union
was completed in a temperature of 180°: the
specific gravity was 1.50 Cooled down to
80°, the whole was solid ; heated to 100°, the
whole became a semi-liquid, uniform mass.
Being afterwards heated to 140°, the whdle
became fluid ; but upon cooling again, the
greatest part congealed at 100°, but 3d or ith
remained liquid down to 47°.—From these
experiments, it is most probable that one atom
of each forms a combination which is solid at
100" or below ; but that being heated, it is
apt to run into the other mode of combination,
or that constituted of two atoms of phosphorus
and one of sulphur. The properties of these

--- Page 495 ---
POTASH. 467

two species of sulphuret of phosphorus I have
not liad an opportunity to investigate. The
water in the tube is evidently decomposed in
part by the compound ; it becomes milky,
probably through the oxide of sulphur, and
both sulphuretted and phosphuretted hydrogen
seem to be formed in small quantities at tem-
peratures above 160°.

SECTION 11.

FIXED ALKALIES,

The fate of the two fixed alkalies, potash
and soda, has been rather remarkable. They
had long been suspected to be compound ele-
ments, but no satisfactory proof was given.
At length Mr. Davy, by his great skill and
address in the application of galvanism to pro-
duce chemical changes, seemed to have estab-
lished the compound nature of these elements,
both by analysis and synthesis. They appeared
to be metallic oxides, or peculiar metals united
to oxygen. Consistent with this idea, some
account of the metals, denominated pocasium
and sodium, has been given in this work. (See
page 260). But from what follows, it ap-
pears most probable, that these metals are

--- Page 496 ---
468 TIXED ALKALIES.

compounds of potash and soda with hydrogen,
and that the two fixed alkalies still remain
among the undecompounded bodies.

1. Potash.

Potash is obtained from the ashes of burned
wood. Water dissolves the saline matter of
the ashes, and may then be poured off and
evaporated by artificial heat: the salt called
potash remains in the vessel. If the salt so
obtained be exposed to a red heat, it loses
combustible matter, becomes white, and is in
part purified : in commerce it is then called
pearl-ash. This mass is still a mixture of va-
rious salts, but is constituted chiefly of car-
bonate of potash. In order to obtain the pot-
ash separate, let a quantity of pearl-ash (or
what is still better, salt of tartar of the shops,
which is this pearl-ash reduced almost to pure
carbonate of potash) be mixed with its weight
of water, and the mixture be stirred ; after
the undissolved salt has subsided, pour uff the
clear solution into an irou pan, and mix with
ita portion of hydrate of lime, half the weight
of the liquid; then add a quantity of water
equal to the weight of the ingredients, and
boil the mixture for several hours, occasionally
adding more water to supply the waste. When

--- Page 497 ---
POTASH. 469

the liquid is found not to effervesce with acids,
the ebullition may be discontinued. After the
lime has subsided, the clear liquid is to be de-
canted, and then boiled down in a clean iron
pan till it assumes a viscid form, and acquires
almost ared heat. It may then be poured
into molds, &c. and it immediately congeals.
The substance so obtained is potash nearly
pure; but it still contains a considerable por-
tion of water, some foreign salts, oxide of
iron, and frequently some unexpelled carbonic
acid. The water may amount to 20 or 25 per
cent. upon the whole weight, and the other
substances to 5 or 10 per cent. In this pro-
cess, the carbonic acid of the potash is trans-
ferred to the lime.

If potash of still greater purity be required,
the method practised by Berthollet may be pur-
sued. The solid potash obtained as above
must be dissolved in alcohol ; the foreign salts
will fall to the bottom insoluble; the liquid
solution may then be decanted into a silver
bason, the alcohol be evaporated, and the fluid
potash exposed to a red heat. It may be
poured out upon a clean polished surface,
where it instantly congeals into solid plates of
potash, which are to be broken and put into
well stoppered bottles, to prevent the access of
air and moisture. This potash is a solid,

--- Page 498 ---
470 FIXED ALKALIES.

brittle, white mass, consisting of about 84
parts potash and 16 water, in 100 parts, and
is the purest that has ever yet been obtained.

Potash may be exhibited in a more regular
crystalline form by admitting more water to
it. If the solution be reduced to the specific
gravity of 1.6, or 1.5, upon cooling, crystals
will be formed, containing about 53 per cent.
of water, or more, if the air is cold. ‘Fhese
crystals are called hydrate of potash. Hence
solid hydrate of potash may be formed, con-
taining from 84 per cent. of potash to 47, or
under,

Potash has a very acrid taste ; it is exceed-
ingly corrosive if applied to the skin, so as to
obtain the name of caustic. The specific gra-
vity of the common sticks of potash used by
surgeons, I find to be 2.1; but these are a
mixture or potash and carbonate of potash,
with 20 or 30 per cent. of water. If pot-ash
were obtained pure, I apprehend its specific
gravity would be about 2.4.

When crystals of potash (that is. the hy-
drate) are exposed to heat, they become liquid,
the water is gradually dissipated with a hissing
noise, till at length the fluid acquires a red
heat. It then remains tranquil for some time ;
but if the heat be increased, white fumes be-
gin to arise copiously. The alkali and water

--- Page 499 ---
POTASH. ATL

both evaporate in this case ; therefore, the pro-
cess cannot be used to expel the last portion of
water from the alkali. If the hydrate be taken
in the red hot and tranquil state, it contains
84 per cent. potash and 16 water. This is
ascertained by saturating a given weight of it
with sulphuric acid, when sulphate of potash
is formed free from water, and 100 parts of
the hydrate give only 84 parts to the new
compound.

Water has a strong affinity for potash. Ifa
portion of the 84 per cent. hydrate be put into
as much water, great heat is immediately pro-
duced, equal to that of boiling water. But it
is observable that the crystallized hydrate con-
taining much water, when mixed with snow,
produces excessive cold. When potash is ex-
posed to the air, it attracts moisture and car-
bonic acid, becoming a liquid carbonate. Pot-
ash dissolved in water, and kept in a stoppered
bottle, retains its causticity: it is called al-
kaline ley, and may be had of various strengths
and specific gravities.

Potash, and the other alkalies, change ve-
getable colours, particularly blues, into green.
—Potash is of great utility in the arts and ma-
nufactures, particularly in bleaching, dying,
printing, soap and glass manufactures. It
unites with most acids to form salts. It does

--- Page 500 ---
472 FIXED ALKALIES,

not unite with any of the simple substances,
as far as is yet known, except hydrogen, and
that in a circuitous way, as will presently be
noticed. The hydrate of potash unites with
sulphur ; but the compound, consisting .of
three or more principles, cannot yet be dis-
cussed.

The theory of the nature and origin of pot-
ash still remains in great obscurity. The great
question, whether it is a constituent principle
of vegetables, or formed during their combus-
tion, is not yet satisfactorily answered. One
circumstance is favourable to the investigation
of the nature of potash, the weight of its ulti-
mate particle is easily ascertained; it forms
very definite compounds with most of the
acids, from which it appears to be 42 times
the weight of hydrogen. The following pro-
portions of the most common salts with base
of potash, are deduced from my experience :
they are such that good authorities may be
found both for greater and less proportions of
the different elements,

The above salts are capable of sustaining a
ted heat, and may therefore be supposed to
be free from water ; at all events, the potash
must contain the same quantity of water in
combination with the respective acids, as ap-
pears from the uniformity of its weight. The
above numbers, 19, 34, 38 and 22 represent,
as the reader will recollect, the weights of the
atoms of the respective acids, except the nitric,
which is double. As water has so strong an
affinity for potash, and as the weight of the
elementary particle of potash above deduced
is more than five times that of water, it may
still be supposed that water enters into the
constitution of potash, or that it is compounded
of some of the lighter earths with azote, oxy-
gen, &c. [rom present appearances, how-
ever, the notion that potash is a simple sub-
stance seems more probable than ever.

From the above observations, it appears that
potash ought still to be considered as a simple
substance, and would require to be placed
among such substances, but that it cannot be
obtained alone. In that state which ap-
proaches nearest to purity it isa hydrate, con-
taining at least 1 atom of water united to 1 of
potash, amounting to 16 per cent. of water.
This hydrate is therefore a ¢ernary compound,
or onc of three elements, and ought to be post-

poned till the next chapter: but, in the pre-
sent state of chemical science, utility must be
allowed in some instances to supersede me-
thodical arrangements. The fixed alkalies are
most useful chemical agents, and the sooner
we become acquainted with them the better ;
more especially, as some of the first chemists
of the present age have been led intc consi-
derable mistakes, by presuming too much upon
their knowledge of the nature and properties
of these familiar articles.

In the Memoires de U Institut de France,
1806, Berthollet published researches on the
laws of affinity, from which some extracts are
given in the Journal de Physique for March
1807.—By these, it appears that he found sul-
phate of barytes to consist of 26 acid and 74
base, and sulphate of potash of $$ acid and 67
base. The former of these results was corro-
borated by the previous experience of The-
nard ; but both are so remote from the uniform
results of other chemists, that they could never
be generally adopted. At length Berthollet
discovered the error, and has announced it in
the 2d vol. of the Memoires d’Arcueil. It
consisted in mistaking the hydrates of barytes
and potash for pure barytes and potash. It
seems to have been generally adopted, but
certainly prematurely, that barytes and potash,

--- Page 503 ---
HYDRATE OF POTASH. 475

ina state of fusion, were pure, or free from
water. But upon due investigation, he found
that fused potash contains 14 per cent. of wa-
ter: my experience as well as theory, leads.
me to adopt 16 per cent. of water, which ac-
cords with the position of 1 atom of each of
the elements uniting to form the hydrate ;
namely, 42 by weight of potash with 8 of
water. This discovery reconciles the jarring
results on the proportions of the above neutral
salts, and throws light upon some other inter-
esting subjects of chemical analysis.

2. Hydrate of Potash.

Upon turning my attention to this subject,
I soon perceived the want of a table exhibit-
ing the relative quantities of potash and water
in all the combinations of these two elements.
Ina state of solution, the specific gravity may
be taken as a guide; but this is not quite so
convenient when the compound is in a solid
form. I found nothing of the kind in any
publication, and therefore undertook a course
of experiments to determine the relative quan-
tities of potash, 8c. in the various solutions.
The results are contained in the following
table, which I would have to be considered

only as an approximation to truth ; but it wil:
certainly have its use till a more complete and
accurate one be obtained. Dr. Henry was so
obliging as to facilitate my progress, by pre-
senting me with portions of the fixed alkalies,
prepared after Berthollet’s method.

Remarks on the Table.

The first column contains the number of
atoms of potash and water in the several com

--- Page 505 ---
HYDRATE OF POTASH. 417

binations to 10 atoms of water: the weight of
an atom of potash is taken to be 42, and 1 of
water 8. From these data the second column
is calculated. There did not appear any strik-
ing characteristic of distinction between the
first, second, third, 8c. hydrates, (if they may
be so called) except that the first bears a red
heat in the liquid form, with tranquillity and
without loss of weight. Before this, the wa-
ter is gradually dissipated with a hissing noise
and fumes. I remarked, however, that when
a solution of potash is boiled down till the
thermometer indicates upwards of 300°, the
evaporation of the water, and the rise of the
thermometer, are desultory ; that is, the ope-
rations appear somewhat stationary for a time,
and then advance quickly ; how far this may
arise from the nature of the compound, or
from the imperfect conducting power of the
liquid in those high temperatures, I could not
determine without more frequent repetitions
of the experiment.

The third column is, as usual, obtained by
multiplying the second column by the specific
gravity ; it is often more convenient in prac-
tice to estimate quantity by measure than by
weight.

The fourth column denotes the specific gra-
vity ; below 1.60 the hydrate is coipletely

--- Page 506 ---
478 FIXED ALKALIES,

fluid, or may be made so by a moderate heat ;
but above that temperature, I found some dif-
ficulty in ascertaining the specific gravity, and
was obliged sometimes to infer it from the
tenor of the table. The commion sticks of
potash of the druggists are of the sp. gr. 2.1,
which I found by plunging them into a gra-
duated tube filled with mercury, and marking
the quantity that overflowed. hese sticks
are a mixture of hydrate and carbonate. Real
potash must, I conceive, be heavier than they
are. The relation of the second and fourth
columns was ascertained by taking a given
weight of the alkaline solution, saturating it
with test sulphuric acid (1.134), and allowing
21 grains of alkali for every 100 measures of
acid (containing 17 real) which the alkali re-
quired.

The 5th column denotes the temperatures at
which the different hydrates congeal or crys-
tallize. This part of the subject deserves much
more accurate enquiry than I have been able
to bestow upon it. No doubt the different
hydrates might be distinguished this way.
Proust talks of a crystallized hydrate of potash,
containing $0 per cent. of water; and Lowitz
of one containing 43 per cent. of water. They
calculate, I presume, upon the supposition of
fused potash being free from water; if so,

--- Page 507 ---
CARBONATE OF POTASH. 479

Proust’s hydrate is the fourth of our table, and
Lowitz’s the sixth. I would not have much
trust to be put in the temperatures I have
marked in this column.

The sixth column indicates the temperatures
at which the different specific gravities boil.
This is easily ascertained, except for the high
degrees, in which an analysis of the hydrate
was required upon every experiment. I believe
the results will be found tolerably accurate.
As the range of temperature is large, this may
be found a very convenient method of ascer-
taining the strength of alkaline solutions, when
the specific gravities are unknown,

8. Carbonate of Potash.

Though it be premature to enter into the
nature of carbonate of potash, a triple com-
pound, yet its utility as a test is such as to
require it to be noticed in the present section.
Indeed it may generally be a substitute for the
hydrate of potash, and it can much more rea-
dily be procured in a state of comparative
purity. The carbonate I mean is that which
consists of one atom of acid united to one of
potash, which by some writers is called a sub-
carbonate. It is, of course, constituted of 19

--- Page 508 ---
480 FIXED ALKALIES.

parts of acid by weight united to 42 of potash.
This salt is to be had in tolerable purity of the
druggists, under the name of salt of tartar ;
but when it is to be used in solution for pure
carbonate, a large quantity of the salt, anda
small quantity of water, are to be mixed and
agitated ; then let the undissolved salt subside,
and pour off the clear solution, which may be
diluted with water, &c.

This salt is well known to be, like the dry
hydrate of potash, very deliquescent. I took
43 grains of carbonate af potash that had just
before been made red hot, put them into a
glass capsule exposed to the air; in one day
the weight became 60 grains ; in three days,
61 grains ; in seven days, 75 grains; in 11
days, 89 grains; in 21 days, 89+ grains; in
25 days, 90 grains. The specific gravity was
1.54 nearly. All the water is, however, driven
off by a moderate heat; namely, that of 280°.
It supports a high red heat before fusion, and
when fused loses no weight, remaining with-
out sublimation, and undecompounded. I
ascertained that it was a perfect carbonate, by
dissolving 61 grains of pure dry salt in lime
water, when +2 grains of carbonate of lime
were thrown down, corresponding to 19 grains
of carbonic acid.

This table is similar in structure to the pre-
ceding. The first column contains the number
of atoms of water joined to one of carbonate of
potash, which last weighs 61. The second
contains the weight of carbonate of potash per
cent. in the compound, and the third the
grains of carbonate in 100 water grain mea-
sures of the compound, found by multiplying

--- Page 510 ---
482 FIXED ALKALIES.

the numbers in the second and fourth columns
together. The fourth contains the specific
gravities ; the relations of these to the quan-
tities in the second columu were found, by
taking a given weight of the solution, and sa-
turating it with a certain number of measures
of test sulphuric acid (1.134), allowing 21 real
potash, or 301 carbonate, for every 100 mea-
sures of acid required ; because such acid con-
tains 17 per cent. by measure of real sulphuric
acid, and that requires 21 of potash.

‘The strongest solution of this salt that can be
obtained is of the specific gravity 1.54. This
consists of 1 atom of carbonate and 8 of water ;
but by putting dry carbonate into that solution,
various mixtures may be formed up to the spe-
cific gravity 1.80; above that the specific gra-
vity is scarcely to be obtained but by inference.
I could not obtain a solid stick of fused car-
bonate but what was spongy, I suppose from
incipient decomposition. It may be observed,
that the specific gravity 1.25, which contains
$0 per cent. of carbonate, is that which I
prefer as a test for acids ; because the solution
contains 21 per cent. pure potash, and 100
measures of it consequently require 100 mea-
sures of the test acids.

I found a specimen of the pearl-ash of com-
merce to contain 54 parts carbonate of potash,

--- Page 511 ---
CARBONATE OF POTASH.. 483

22 parts of other salts, and 2% parts of water
in the hundred.

The fifth column denotes the temperature
at which the saline solutions boil. This will
be found generally a zood approximation to
truth. I observed the thermometer did not
rise above 280° as long as any visible moisture
remained ; as soon as that vanished, the salt
assumed the character of a hard and perfectly
dry substance.

In the course of these experiments, I took
a quantity of carbonate of potash, and heated
it red hot ; then weighed it ; after which I
put to it as much water as afforded 1 atom to
1; namely, 8 parts water to 61 salt. The
salt was then pulverized in a mortar ; it was
put out upon white paper, and appeared a
white, dry salt; but upon pouring it back
into the mortar, some particles of the salt ad-
hered to the paper. The same quantity of
water was again put to it. Upon mixing
them with a knife, the whole mass assumed a
pasty consistence, and adhered to the knife in
the shape of a ball; after being well rubbed
in the mortar, it again assumed a white, dry
appearance. Upon paper, it seemed like salt
of tartar some time exposed to the air. Several
particles stuck to the paper, but were easily
removed by a knife. The addition of another

--- Page 512 ---
484 FIXED ALKALIES,

atom of water reduced the compound to the
consistence of bird-lime ; but after standing
it cut like half dried clay. The next atom of
water reduced it to the consistence of book-
binders paste. The fifth atom of water re-
duced it to a thick fluid, consisting of dis-
solved and undissolved salt. This, by the suc-
cessive application of like portions of water,
became a perfect fluid with 8 atoms of water
to 1 of carbonate of potash. Its specific gra-
vity was 1.5; but there was some undissolved
sulphate of potash subsided, the salt of tartar
not having been previously purified.

4. Potasium, or Hydruret of Potash.

Since writing the articles on Potasium and
Sodium (page 260 and seq.), and the subse-
quent articles on fluoric and muriatic acid
(page 277 and seq.), a good deal more light
has been thrown on these subjects. Two pa-
pers on the subjects have been published by
Mr. Davy ; a series of essays by Gay Lussac
and Thenard, are contained in the 2d vol. of
the Memoires d’Arcueil ; the same volume
also contains a paper by Berthollet, announc-
ing an important discovery relating to the fixed
alkalies ;.namely, that in a state of fusion by

--- Page 513 ---
POTASIUM, OR KYDRURET OF POTASH. 485.

heat, they contain a definite proportion of
water in chemical combination. Upon re-
considering the former facts, and comparing
them with the more recent ones, I am obliged
to adopt new views respecting the nature of
these new metals. Mr. Davy still adheres to
his original views, and which indeed were the
only rational ones that could be formed (sup-
posing the fused alkalies to contain no water),
namely, that potash is the oxide of potasium ;
Gay Lussac and Thenard, on the contrary,
consider potash as undecompounded, and po-
tasium a compound of hydrogen and potash,
analogous to the other known compounds of
hydrogen and clementary principles. This
Jast is the only one, I think, that can be ad-
mitied either from synthetic or analytic expe-
riments, so as to be reconcileable with the
facts ; but I do not coincide with all the con-
clusions which the French chemists have de-
duced. Mr. Davy has furnished us with the
most definite and precise facts ; and though I
was led to controvert some of them (see page
289 and seq.), it was principally through my
having adopted his views of the nature of po-
tasium: I am now persuaded those results were
more accurate than I imagined.

Mr. Davy first attempted to decompose the
fixed alkalies, by applying Voltaic electricity

--- Page 514 ---
486 POTASH WITH HYDROGEN.

to saturated watery solutions ; in this case,
oxygen and hydrogen gas were obtained, evi-
dently proceeding, as he concluded, from the
decomposition of the water. But when any
potash that had previously been fused, was
substituted for the watery solution, no hydro-
gen gas was given out at the negative pole,
but potasium was formed, and pure oxygen
was given out at the positive pole. ‘The re-
sidual potash was unaltered. The conclusion
he drew was, that the potash was decomposed
into potasium and oxygen. But it now ap-
pears, that fused potash is composed of 1 atom
of water and 1 of potash. ‘The electricity
Operates upon this last atom of water to se-
parate its elements ; it succeeds in detaching
the atom of oxygen, but that of hydrogen
draws the atom of potash along with it, form-
ing an atom of potasium. The atom of hy-
drate weighing 50 (= 42 potash + 8 water) is
decomposed into one of potasium, weighing
43, and one of oxygen weighing 7. ence
the atom of potasium is composed of 1 pot-
ash + 1 hydrogen, weighing 43 ; and not of
1 potash — 1 oxygen, weighing 35, as stated
at page 262.

The method of obtaining potasium, disco-
vered by the French chemists, is to find the
first hydrate of potash in a staté of yapour over

--- Page 515 ---
POTASIUM, OR HYDRURET OF POTASH. 487

red hot iron turnings, in an iron tube intensely
heated ; hydrogen gas is given out, potasium
is formed and condensed in a cool part of the
tube, and part of the potash is found united
to the iron. In this mode of producing pota-
sium, its constitution is not so obvious as in
the former. The two methods, however, to-
gether, shew that fused potash contains both
oxygen and hydrogen, which is now abun-
dantly confirmed by experiments of a different
kind. It seems probable that in the latter
method the hydrate of potash is partly decom-
posed into potash and water, and partly into
potasium and oxygen ; in both cases the iron
acquires the oxygen.

The specific gravity of potasium is .G, or
.796, according to Davy ; but .874 according
to Gay Lussac and Thenard. The levity of it,
combined with its volatility at a low red heat,
agrees with the notion of its being potash and
hydrogen, or potassetted hydrogen, resembling
the other known compounds of sulphur, phos-
phorus, charcoal, arsenic, &c. combined with
hydrogen.

“When burned in oxygen gas, potasium pro-
duces potash as dry as possible to be procured,
according to Mr. Davy; that is, the first hy-
drate. When potasium is thrown into water
it burns rapidly, decomposing the water, and

--- Page 516 ---
488 POTASH WITH HYDROGEN,

giving off hydrogen. Calculating the oxygen
from the quantity of hydrogen, Mr. Davy finds
100 (hydrate of) potash contain from 13 to 17
oxygen: Gay Lussac seems to make it 14.
For, 2.284 grammes of potasium gave 649
cubic centimetres of hydrogen ; reduced, 35.5
grains gave 34.5 cubic inches English measure,
which correspond to 17.25 inches of oxygen
= 5.9 grains. Hence 35.3 + 5.9 = 41.2
grains of hydrate ; and 41.2: 5.9:: 100: 14,
But this is exactly the quantity that theory
would assign ; for, 43 potasium + 7 oxygen
= 50 hydrate, which gives just 14 oxygen in
the hundred.

Potasium burns spontaneously in oxymuriatic
acid gas; muriate of potash is formed, and
probably water. It decomposes sulphuretted,
phosphuretted, and arseniuretted hydrogen gas,
according to Gay Lussac and Thenard, and
unites to the sulphur, &c. with some of the
hydrogen. Mr. Davy finds tellurium to unite
with the hydrate of potash by Voltaic electri-
city without decomposing it, Potasium burns
in nitrous gas and nitrous oxide, forming dry
hydrate of potash, and evolving azote. It
burns in sulphurous and carbonic acid, and in
carbonic oxide ; hydrate of potash which unites
to the sulphur is formed, or hydrate of potash
and charcoal.

--- Page 517 ---
POTASLUM, OR AYDRURET OF POTASH. 489

The combustion of potasium in muriatic acid
gas is particularly worthy of notice. Both Mr.
Davy and the French chemists agree that when
potasium is burned in muriatic acid gas, mu-
riate of potash is formed, and hydrogen evolved,
which agrees in quantity with that evolved in
the decompositixn of water by the same quan-
tity of metal. But, what is most astonishing,
they both adopt the same explanation, when
their different views of the constitution of po-
tasium require them to be opposite, Mr,
Davy had two ways in which he might ac-
count for the phenomenon; the one was to
suppose that a part of the acid was decom-
posed, and furnished the oxygen to the metal
to form the oxide (potash), which joined to
the remainder of the acid, and the hydrogen
was an evolved elementary principle of that
part of the acid decomposed ; and the other,
to suppose that the acid gas contained ina
state of union just as much water as was suffi-
cient to oxidate the metal (this would have
been thought an extraordinary circumstance
a few years ago). Either of these positions
was consistent ; but he adopted the latter,
and seemed to confirm it by shewing that a
given quantity of muriatic acid gas afforded
the same quantity of muriate of silver, whether
combined previously with potash or potasium.

--- Page 518 ---
490 POTASH WITH HYDROGEN.

This explanation did not meet my views as
well as the former. I endeavoured to account
for the facts (page 289) on the notion of a de-
composition of the acid. Two circumstances
conspired to incline me to this view : The one
was, that hydrogen seemed on other accounts
to be a constituent of muriatic acid ; the other
was, that water does not ap:ear in any other
instance to be combined with any elastic fluid ;
I mean in such way that if the water be re-
moved, the rest of the molecule will carry
along with it the character of the whole. In
one respect I mistook the data, having over-
rated the weight of muriatic acid gas.—I
would now be understood to abandon the ex-
planation founded on the decomposition of the
acid ; and to adopt the much more simple one
that the muriatic acid combines with the pot-
ash of the potasium, at the same instant ex-
pelling the hydrogen; in this way there is no
occasion for any water either combined’ or
otherwise. It exceeds my comprehension how
Gay Lussac and Thenard should insist so
largely on the opinion that muriatic acid gas
contains water, and that principally, as it
should seem, in order to account for the hy-
drogen evolved during the combustion of po-
tasium, and the supposed oxydation of the
metal,

--- Page 519 ---
POTASIUM, OR HYDRURET OF POTASH. 491

It has been stated that potasium burns in
silicated fluoric acid gas (page 283), the result
is fluate of potash and some hydrogen, The
theory of this is not obvious.

Potasium acts upon ammoniacal gas. Mr.
Davy found that when 8 grains of the metal
were fused in ammoniacal gas, between 12+
and 16 cubic inches of the gas were absorbed,
and hydrogen evolved corresponding to the
oxydation of the metal by water, that is, 1
atom of hydrogen for 1 atom of potasium,
The new compound becomes of a dark olive
colour. By applying a greater degree of heat
the ammonia is in part expelled again; but
part is also decomposed. Gay Lussac and
Thenard say, that by admitting a few drops
of water to the compound, the whole of the
elements of the ammonia are recoverable, and
nothing but caustic potash remains. Mr.
Davy affirms the results of the decomposition
to be somewhat different. It seems pretty
evident, that in this process two atoms of am-
monia unite to one of potasium, expelling its
hydrogen at the same moment. _ For, 43 grains
of potasium would require 12 of ammonia ; and
therefore 8 will require 2} grains, which cor-
respond to 12+ cubic inches.

5. Soda.

Soda is commonly obtained from the ashes
of plants growing on the sea-shore, particularly
from a genus called salsols ; in Spain, where
this article is largely prepared, it is called ba-
rilla. In Britain, the various species of fucus
or sea-weed are burnt, and their ashes form a
mixture containing some carbonate of soda ;
this mixture is called kelp. Soda is found in
some parts of the earth combined with car-
bonic acid, and in others combined with mu-
riatic acid, as minerals ; and hence it has been
called the fuss?! or mineral alkali, to distin-
guish it from potash or the vegetable alkali.

To obtain soda in as pure a state as possible,
recourse must be had to a process similar to
that for obtaining potash. Pure carbonate of
soda must be treated with hydrate of lime and
water; the carbonate of soda is decomposed ;
the soda remains in solution in the liquid, the
carbonic acid unites to the lime, and the new
compound is precipitated. Afterwards the
clear liquid must be decanted and boiled
down ; the water gradually goes off with a
hissing noise till the soda acquires a low red
heat, when the alkali and remaining water
become a tranquil liquid. This liquid may be

--- Page 521 ---
SODA. 493

tun out into molds, &c. when it instantly con-
geals into a hard mass, and is then to be pre-
served in bottles for use. IF still greater heat
be applied, the alkali and water are together
dissipated in white fumes.

Soda thus obtained is a solid, brittle, white
mass, consisting of about 78 parts pure soda
and 22 water per cent. ; according to d’Arcet
(Annales de Chimie, Tome 68, p. 182) the
alkali is only 72; but I believe that is too low.
With more water, soda may be had in crystals,
like potash, probably containing 50 or 60 per
cent. of water. Soda, like potash, is extremely
caustic ; it is deliquescent, and produces heat
when dissolved in water. The specific gra-
vity of fused soda I find to be 2, by pouring it
into a graduated glass tube. There is some
reason to apprehend that pure soda, could it
be obtained, would be specifically heavier than
potash, though its ultimate particle is certainly
of less weight than that of the latter. The
properties and uses of soda are much the same
as those of potash ; indecd, the two alkalies
were long confounded, on account of their re-
semblances. “The compounds into which they
enter arc in many instances essentially different,
and the weights of their atoms are very un-
equal. The origin of soda in vegetables is
somewhat obscure, though it may be derived

--- Page 522 ---
494 FIXED ALKALIES.

from the muriate of soda in the water of
the sea.

The weight of an atom of soda is easily de-
rived from the many definite compounds which
it forms with the acids ; it appears to be 28
times that of hydrogen. The carbonate, sul-
phate, nitrate and muriate of soda, are all well
known salts. From a comparison of my own
experiments with those of others on the pro-
portions of these salts, free from water, 1 de-
duce the following :

per cente

Carbonate of soda 40.4 acid, + 59.6 base, as 19 : 28

Sulphate 54.8—— 45.2 34: 28
Nitrate ——— 57.6-—— 424—— 38:28
Muriate ———~ 44 —— 56. —— 22:28

‘These proportions scarcely differ 1 per cent.
from those of Kirwan and other good autho-
tities. The numbers 19, 34, 38 and 22 being
the weights of the respective atoms of acids,
the number 28 must be the weight of an atom
of soda. Hence we find that soda is a peculiar
element, differing from every one we have yet
determined in weight. From the weight of
the element soda, it may be suspected to be a
compound of water, oxygen, or some of the
lighter clements ; but from present appear-
ances, no such suspicion seems well founded.
Soda should then, with propriety, be treated

--- Page 523 ---
HYDRATE OF SODA. 495

as an elementary principle. We shall proceed
to the hydrate, the carbonate, and the hy-
druret of soda, for reasons which have been
given under the head of potash.

6. Hydrate of Soda.

Soda, in what has till lately been considered
its pure state, is combined with water. The
smallest portion of water seems to be one atom
to one of soda; that is, § parts of water by
weight to 28 of soda, or 22 per cent. of wa-
ter. I have not obtained soda purer than that
of d’Arcet of 72 per cent. ; but it always con-
tained some carbonic acid and other impu-
rities, which incline me to conclude that 78
per cent. would be the highest attainable pu-
rity ; this may be called the first hydrate : it is
hard and brittle, and twice the weight of wa-
ter. The second, third, fourth, and fifth hy-
drates are, I apprehend, crystalline ; but niy
experience does not warrant me to decide upon
their nature ; the sixth, and those with more
water, are all liquid at the ordinary tempera-
ture ; their specific gravity is obtained in the
usual way, and the corresponding quantity of
real alkali is ascertained by the test acids.

The following Table for soda, is constructed
after the manner of that for potash (page 476),

It will be found moderately accurate ; but I
could aot give it the attention it deserves.
Nothing of the kind has been published to my
knowledge ; yet, such tables appear to me so
necessary to the practice of chemical enquiries,
that I have wondered how the science could
be so long cultivated without them.

That solution which will be found most
convenient for a test, is of the specific gravity
1.16 or 1.17, and contains 14 per cent. by
measure of real alkali ; consequently, 100 mea-
sures require the same volume of acid tests for

their saturation.

CARBONATE OF SODA. 497

7. Carbonate of Soda.

The salt I call carbonate of soda, is to be
had of the druggists in great purity, under the
name of purified sub-carbonate of soda, It is
obtained in the form of large crystals, contain-
ing much water ; but when exposed to the air
for some time, these crystals lose most of their
water, and become like flour. I took 100
gtains of fresh crystallized carbonate of soda,
and exposed it to the action of the air in a
saucer : In 1 day it was reduced to 80 grains ;
in 2 days, to 6+ grains; in 4 days, to 49 grains ;
in 6 days, to 45 grains ; in 8 days, to 44 grains ;
and in 9 days it was still 44 grains, had the
appearance of fine dry flour, and probably
would have lost no more weight. It was then
exposed to a red heat, after which it weighed
$7 grains nearly. Now, it isa well established
fact, that the common carbonate of soda, heated
red, is constituted of 19 parts of acid and 28
of soda ; or 40.4 acid and 59.6 base, per cent.
nearly. Klaproth says, 42 acid, 58 base ;
Kirwan says, 40.1 acid, 59.9 base. It is
equally well established that the crystallized
carbonate recently formed in a low tempe-
rature, contains about 63 per cent. water, as
above determined, All experience confirms

--- Page 526 ---
493 FIXED ALKALIES.

this; Bergman and Kirwan find 64 parts of
water, Klaproth 62, and d’Arcet 63.6. Hence
the constitution of the crystallized carbonate
js easily ascertained ; for, if $7 : 63 ::47
(= 19 + 28) : 80, the weight of water attached
to each atom of the carbonate ; that is, 10
atoms of water unite to 1 of carbonate of soda
to form the common crystals. Again, if 47:
8::37:6.3 =the weight of water attached
to 37 parts of carbonate of soda, to correspond
with | atom of water; but 37 + 6.8 = 43.3;
from this it appears that 100 parts of crystal-
lized carbonate being reduced to 44 or 43,3,
indicates that all the 10 atoms of water are
evaporated, except one, It should seem, then,
that the ordinary efflorescence of this salt is not
dry carbonate, but 1 atom of carbonate and 1
of water. This supposition is confirmed by ex-
perience ; for, in 5 days the above 37 grains of
heated carbonate became 44 grains by ex-
posure to the air.

There is another very remarkable character
of the carbonate of soda, which, however, I
apprehend will be found to arise from a ge-
neral law in chemistry ; when a quantity of
common crystallized carbonate is exposed to
heat in a glass retort, as soon as it attains a
temperature about 150°, it becomes fluid as
water; but when this fluid is heated to 212°,

--- Page 527 ---
CARBONATE OF SODA, 499

and kept boiling a while, a hard, small grained,
salt is precipitated from the liquid, which,
upon examination, I find to be the fifth hy-
drate, or one atom of carbonate of soda united
to 5 atoms of water. For, 100 grains of this
salt lose 46 by a red heat ; but 1 atom of car-
bonate weighs 47, and 5 atoms of water weigh
40, together making 87; now, if 87 of such
salt contain 40 water, 100 will contain 46.—
The clear liquid resting upon the fifth hydrate
has the specific gravity 1.35; on cooling, the
whole liquid crystallizes into a fragile, icy mass,
which dissolves with a very moderate heat.
This appears by the test acid to be constituted
of 1 atom of carbonate and 15 atoms of water.
Thus the tenth hydrate, by heat, is resolved
and converted into the fifth and fifteenth ; in
like manner, probably, the fifteenth might be
transformed into the tenth and thirtieth hy-
drate. When any solution below 1.55 sp.
gravity is set aside to csystallize, the fifteenth
hydrate is formed in the liquid, and finally the
residuary liquid is reduced to the sp. gravity of
1.18. By treating this liquid solution with
the test acids, it will be found to consist of 1
atom of carbonate. to 30 of water. It is of
course that solution which the common crys-
tals of carbonate always form, when duly agi-
tated with water: or a saturated solution at

--- Page 528 ---
500 F(XED ALKALIES.

the mean ordinary temperature of the atmo-
sphere. By heat, other liquid solutions may
be obtained from 1.85 to 1.35 ; but they soon
crystallize ; such may be called supersaturated
solutions.

‘The different species of hydrates in crystals
have different specific gravities, as might be
expected ; that of the fifteenth is 1.35, that
of the tenth is {.42, and that of the fifth 1.64.
These were found by dropping the crystals
into solutions of carbonate of potash till they
were suspended, or by weighing them in sa-
turated solutions of the same. I could not
ascertain that of the pure carbonate and the
first hydrate.

When carbonate of soda is used for a test
alkali, the specific gravity 1.22 would be that
solution which contains 14 per cent. by mea-
sure of alkali, of which 100 measures would
require 100 of test acid for saturation ; but, as
that solution cannot be preserved without par-
tial crystallization, it will be better to substitute
a solution of half the strength ; namely, that of
1,11; then 200 measures of the solution will
require 100 of test acid.

The following Table contains the characters
of various combinations of carbonate of soda
and water, resulting from my investigations.

The state of the carbonates in the above
table it may be proper to notice. The pure
carbonate is in the state of a dry powder ; so
is the first hydrate, not to be distinguished in
appearance from the pure carbonate. The
fifih hydrate may be obtained in a crystalline
mass, by heating the common carbonate till
a proper portion of water is driven off. Its
specific gravity is then easily found. The
tenth hydrate is the common carbonate of the
shops in crystals, The fifteenth hydrate may
be had either in a liquid or solid form, as has
been observed. The twentieth hydrate is a
liquid without any remarkable distinction that
I have discovered. It is liable to partial crys-
tallization. The thirtieth hydrate is a liquid,
being the saturated solution at common tem-

perature ; this would probably wholly crys-
tallize at no very reduced temperature. The
2d, $d, 4th, 6th, &c. hydrates, I have not
found to offer any remarkable discrimination.

8. Sodium, or Hydruret of Soda.

According to the present state of our know-
ledge, the account of sodium given at page
262, will require some modification, As the
article from which sodium has always been
obtained is the first hydrate of soda, and as in
the electrization of fused hydrate of soda, no
gas is given out, according to Mr. Davy, but
oxygen ; it follows of course that sodium must
be a compound of soda and hydrogen, which
may be called a hydruret of soda. Mr. Davy,
conceiving soda in a state of fusion to be pure
or free from water, as was the conimon opinion
at the time, concluded that in the electrization
of it the soda was decomposed into sodium
and oxygen. This conclusion does not now
appear to be tenable, though Mr. Davy stilk
adheres to it, without having shewn what be-
comes of the water acknowledged to be pre-
sent in every instance of the formation of so-
dium and potasium (Philos, Trans. 1809), to

--- Page 531 ---
SODIUM, 503

the amount of 16 per cent. upon the com-
pound.

Though Mr. Davy’s original method of ob-
taining sodium by Voltaic electricity is the
most instructive, as to the nature of the new
product, yet, that of Gay Lussac and Thenard
is the most convenient when a quantity of the
article is required. That is, to pass the vapour
of red hot hydrate of soda over iron turnings
in a gun barrel, heated to whiteness. The
hydrate scems to be decomposed in two ways ;
in part it is resolved into sodium, or hydruret
of soda, and oxygen, the former of which dis-
tils into a cooler receptacle of the barrel, and
the latter unites to the iron; in part, the hy-
drate is decomposed into water and soda, and
the former again into oxygen, which unites to
the iron, and hydrogen which escapes, whilst
the soda unites to the iron or its oxide, forming
a white metallic compound.

The specific gravity of sodium is stated by
Mr. Davy at .9348. The weight of its ulti-
mate particle (being 1 atom of soda and 1 of
hydrogen) must be 29, and not 2i, as stated
at page 263. Consequently, 100 parts of the
first hydrate of soda, or fused soda, contain
80.6 sodium and 19.4 oxygen per cent. This
agrees with that one of Mr. Davy’s experi-
ments which gave the least portion of oxygen.

--- Page 532 ---
504 EARTHS.

Sodium amalgamates with potasium, ac-
cording to Gay Lussac and Thenard, in va-
rious proportions, and the alloys are more
fusible than either of the simple metals, being
in some cases liquid at the freezing point of
water. In general, the properties of sodium
are found to agree with those of potasium so
nearly, as not to require distinct specification.

SECTION 12.

EARTHS.

The class of bodies called earths by chemists
are nine in number; their names are Lime,
Magnesia, Barytes, Strontites, Alumine or
Argil, Silex, Yttria, Glucine and Zircone.
The three last are recently discovered and
scarce.

The earths constitute the bases of the fossil
kingdom. Though they have frequently been
suspected to be compound bodies, and several
attempts have been made to decompose them,
it does not yet appear but that they are simple
or elementary substances. Some of the earths
possess alkaline properties ; others are without
such properties; but they all partake of the
following characters: 1. They are incombus-

--- Page 533 ---
LIME, 505

tible, or do not unite with oxygen ; 2. they
are inferior to the metals in lustre and opacity ;
8. they are sparingly soluble in water; 4. they
are difficultly fusible, or resist great heat with-
out alteration ; 5. they combine with acids;
6. they combine with each other, and with
metallic oxides; and, 7. their specific gravities
are from 1 to 5

The latest attempt to decompose the earths
is that of Mr. Davy ; he seems to have shewn,
that some of the earths are analogous to the
fixed alkalies, in respect to their properties of
forming metals ; but these metals, like those of
the alkalies, are most probably compoynds of
hydrogen and the respective earths,

1. Lime.

This earth is one of the most abundant ; it is
found in all parts of the world, but in a state
of combination, generally with some acid.
When united with carbonic acid, it exists in
large strata or beds in the form of chalk, lime-
stone,. or marble ; and it is from some of these
that lime is usually obtained.

The common method of obtaining lime, is
to expose pieces of chalk or limestone in a kiln
for a few days to a strong red or white heat ;
by this process, the carbonic acid is driven off,

--- Page 534 ---
506 EARTAS.

and the lime remains in compact masses of
nearly the same size and shape as the lime-
stone, but with the loss of .2,ths of its weight.
It is probable, the intermixture of the lime-
stone and coal in the combustion of the latter
contributes, along with the heat, to the de-
composition. The lime from chalk is nearly
pure; but that from common limestone con-
tains from 10 to 20 per cent. of foreign sub-
stances, particularly alumine, silex, and oxide
of iron.

Lime thus obtained, which is commonly
called quicklime, is white and moderately hard,
but brittle. Its specific gravity, according to
Kirwan, is 2.3. It is corrosive to animal and
vegetable substances ; and, like the alkalies,
converts coloured vegetable infusions, parti-
cularly blue, into green. I[t is infusible. It
has a strong attraction for water, so as to rub
the atmosphere of its vapour ; when exposed
to the atmosphere, it gradually imbibes water,
and ina few days falls down into a fine white
dry powder; in this process, if pure, it ac-
quires 33 per cent. in weight; after this, it
begins to exchange its water for carbonic acid,
and carbonate of Jime is slowly regenerated.
When 1 part of water is thrown upon 2 of
quicklime, the lime quickly falls to powder
with intense heat, calculated to be 800° (page

--- Page 535 ---
LIME. 507

89) ; this operation is called slaking the lime,
and is preparatory to most of its applications 5
the new compound is denominated /ydrute of
lime, and appears to be the only proper com-
bination that subsists between lime and water.
By a red heat the water is driven off and the
lime remains pure.

As lime combines with the principal acids
hitherto considered, and forms with them per-
fectly neutral salts; and as the proportions of
these salts have been experimentally ascertained
with precision, we are enabled to determine
the weights of an atom of lime: thus,

Acid, Base,
Carbonate of lime, 44 -+ 56 percent as 19: 24
Sulphate 58.54 41.4——— 34: 24.
Nitrate ——— 61.34 38.7 ——— 583 + 2h
Muriate 47.84 52.2 22 : 24

Carbonate of lime is, [ believe, universally
allowed to contain either 44 or 45 per cent. of
acid ; and sulphate is mostly supposed to con-
tain 58 per cent. acid, the extremes being 56
and 60. ‘he proportions of the other two
salts haye not been so carefully determined ,
but it is easy to satisfy one’s self that the pro-
portions assigned are not wide of the truth,
Let 43 grains of chalk be put into 200 grain
measures of the test nitric acid (1.143), or the

--- Page 536 ---
508 EARTHS.

test muriatic (1.077), and it will be found that
the lime will be wholly dissolved, and the
acids saturated. lence it follows that the
elementary atom of lime weighs 24. I have
formerly stated it at 23, supposing carbonate of
lime to be, according to Kirwan, 45 acid + 55
lime per cent. The difference is scarcely
worth consideration ; but experience seems to
warrant 24 rather than 23 for the atom of
lime.

When a large quantity of water is thrown
upon a piece of quicklime, it sometimes re-
fuses to slake for a time ; perhaps this is caused
by the water preventing the rise of tempera-
ture. In this case the water does not dissolve
the lime ; hence it should seem that lime pro-
perly speaking is not soluble in water; but
hydrate of lime is readily soluble, though in 3
small degree. The solution is called lime-
water, and is a very useful chemical agent.

Lime-water may be formed by agitating a
quantity of hydrate of lime in water ; distilled
or rain water should be preferred. One brisk
agitation is nearly sufficient to saturate the
water ; but if complete saturation is required,
the agitation should be repeated two or three
times. After the lime has subsided the clear
liquid must be décanted and bottled for use.
Authors differ as to the quantity of lime dis-

--- Page 537 ---
LIME. 509

solved by water: some say that water takes
xis of its weight of lime ; others, 55~. The
fact is, that few have tried the experiment
with due care. Dr. Thomson, in the 4th ed.
of his chemistry says, from his experience, +35.
This is much nearer the truth than the other
two. One author says, that water of 212°
takes up double the quantity of lime that water
of 60° does, but deposits the excess on cool-
ing: no experimental proof is given. If he
had said half instead of double, the assertion
would have been nearly true. I haye made
some experiments on this subject, and the re-
sults are worth notice.

When water of 60° is duly agitated with
hydrate of lime, it clears very slowly; buta
quantity of the lime-water may soon be passed
through a filter of blotting paper, when it be-
comes clear and fit for use. I found 7000
grains of this water require 75 grains of test
sulphuric acid for its saturation. Consequently
it contained 9 grains of lime. Ifa quantity of
this saturated water, mixed with hydrate of
jime, be warmed to 130° and then agitated, it
soon becomes clear ; 7000 grains of this water
decanted, require only 60 grains of test sul-
phuric acid in order to produce saturation.
The same saturated lime-water was boiled with
hydrate of lime for two or three minutes, and

--- Page 538 ---
510 EARTHS,

set aside to cool without agitation ; it very soon
cleared, and 7000 grains being decanted, re-
quired only 46 grains of test acid to be neu-
tralized, the test acid being as usual 1.134.
Hence we deduce the following table.

This table leads us to conclude that water
at the freezing temperature would take nearly
twice the quantity of lime that water at the
boiling temperature takes ; I had not an op-
portunity to try this in the season of these ex-
periments ; but I am informed the calico-
printers find a sensible difference in lime-water
in different seasons of the year, and that in
winter it is most subservient to their purpose,
and least soin summer. As water takes up so
small a portion of lime, and cold water more
than warm, one would suppose it was the ef-
fect of suspension rather than solution. With
this view I tried whether the addition of a little
gum to the water would not increase its solvent
power ; but the result was, that water of 60°
took precisely the same quantity of lime, whe-
ther with or without gum. I found that a
deep carthen vessel which had stood some

--- Page 539 ---
LIME. Sil

months with lime-water exposed to the air,
still contained 4, of its weight of lime.
Lime-water has an acrid taste, notwith-
standing the small quantity of lime. It operates
on colours like the alkalies. Certain blue co-
Jours, such as syrup of violets, are changed to
green; infusion of litmus, which has been
converted from blue to red by a little acid,
has its blue colour restored by lime-water, and
archil solution, reddened by an acid, is restored
to its purple colour by lime-water, When ex-
posed to the air, lime-water has a thin crust
formed on its surface ; this is carbonate of
lime, the acid being derived from the atmo-
sphere ; it is insoluble, and falls to the bottom ;
in time the whole of the lime is thus converted
into carbonate, and the water remains pure.
If a person breathes through a tube into lime-
water, it is rendered milky through the forma-
tion of carbonate, or if water containing car-
Bonic acid be poured into it; but a double
quantity of the acid forms a supercarbonate of
lime, which is soluble in a considerable degree.
Though lime is soluble in water in so small a
quantity, yet a portion of distilled water may
be mixed with ,4, of its bulk of lime-water,
and the presence of Jime will be shewn by the
test colours, or by nitrate of mercury, &c.
Lime combines with sulphur and with phos-

--- Page 540 ---
512 EARTHS.

phorus: these compounds will be considered
under the heads of sulphurets and phosphurets.
It combines also with the acids, and forms
with them neutral salts. Lime unites to certain
metallic oxides, particularly those of mercury
and lead; but the nature of these last com-
pounds is not much known.

One of the great uses of lime is in the for-
mation of mortar. In order to form mortar,
the lime is slaked and mixed up with a quan-
tity of sand, and the whole well wrought up
into the consistence of paste with as little water
as possible. This cement, properly interposed
amongst the bricks or stones of buildings, gra-
dually hardens and adheres to them so as to
bind the whole together. This is partly, per-
haps principally, owing to the regeneration of
the carbonate of lime from the carbonic acid
of the atmosphere. The best ingredients and
their proportions to form mortar for different
purposes, do not seem yet to be well un-
derstood.

2. Magnesia.

‘This earth is obtained from a salt now called
sulphate of magnesia, which abounds in sea-
water and in some natural springs. According
to the best analyses, crystallized sulphate of

--- Page 541 ---
MAGNESIA, 513

magnesia consists of 56 parts of pure dry sul-
phate, and 44 parts water in the hundred.
Some authors find more water in this salt ;
namely, from 48 to 53 per cent.; but Dr.
Henry, in his analysis of British and foreign
salt, in the Philos. Trans. 1810, takes notice
of a crystallized sulphate of magnesia contain-
ing only 44 per cent. water ; and the specimen
of sulphate which I have had for many years
bears the same character. I am, therefore,
inclined to adopt this as the true proportion of
water. Now, Dr. Henry found that 100 grains
of the above sulphate of magnesia produced
111 or 112 grains of sulphate of barytes ; and
it is well established that + of this last salt is
acid ; hence, the sulphuric acid in 100 sul-
phate of magnesia (56 real) is equal to 37
grains ; consequently the magnesia is equal to
19 grains: but the weight of an atom of sul-
phuric acid is $4; therefore, 37:19 : : $4: 17,
nearly, which must be the weight of an atom
of magnesia, on the supposition that sulphate
of magnesia is constituted of one atom of acid
united to one of base, of which there is no
reason to doubt, I have in the first part of
this work, page 219, stated the weight of mag-
nesia to be 20 ; it was deduced chiefly from
Kirwan’s analysis of sulphate of magnesia ; but

--- Page 542 ---
514 EARTHS.

from present experience I think it is too high.
Though few of the salts of magnesia have been
analyzed with great precision, yet the weigtt
of the atom of magnesia derived from different
analyses would not fall below 17, nor rise
above 20. Dr. Henry and I analyzed the
common carbonate of magnesia well dried in
100°, and found it to lose 40 per cent. by acids,
and 57 per cent. by a moderate red heat. Hence
it should consist of 43 magnesia, 40 carbonic
acid, and 17 water. We found the carbonate
begin to give out water and some acid about
450° ; but it supported a heat of 550° for an
hour without losing morc than 16 per cent.
Ifence the carbonate must be constituted of 1
atom of acid, 1 of magnesia, and 1 of water,
stating the magnesia at 20 ; for, 19 + 8 + 20
= 47; and if 47: 19, 8, and 20:: 100: 40,
17 and 48 respectively, according to the above
experiments. I have reason to think, however,
that the weight of the atom of magnesia ought
rather to be deduced from the sulphate than
the carbonate ; because it is probable that this
last always contains a small portion of sulphate
of lime, when prepared by the medium of
common spring water; this portion will be
found in the result of the analysis by fire, and
will be placed to the account of magnesia.

--- Page 543 ---
MAGNESIA. 515

Wherefore 1 conclude the weight of an atom
of magnesia to be 17. It is said that a super-
carbonate of magnesia is obtainable ; but when
sulphate of magnesia and supercarbonate of
soda in solution are mixed together, there is a
great effervescence and disengagement of car-
bonic acid, and nothing but the common car-
bonate of magnesia is precipitated according
to my experience. Dr, Henry, indeed, ob-
tained a crystallization by exposing a dilute
mixture for some time ; the crystals were small
opake globules, about the size of small shot ;
but upon examination, they proved to be no-
thing but carbonate of magnesia united to 3
atoms of water instead of 1 atom. For, 100
grains lost 70 by a red heat, and 30 by acids ;
whence its constitution was 30 acid + 30 earth
+ 40 water, or 19 acid + 19 earth + 24 or 25
water. The constitution of crystallized sul-
phate of magnesia must, therefore, be 1 atom
of acid + 1 atom of magnesia + 5 atoms of
water ; in weight $4 + 17+ 40 =91; this
gives per cent. $7 acid + 19 base + 44 water,
agreeably to Dr. Henry’s experience above-
mentioned.

The constitution of the most common salts
of magnesia, in their dry state will, therefore,
be as under:

The nitrate of magnesia in the above table
agrees with that of Kirwan, and Richter, and
the muriate with that of Wenzel.

To obtain magnesia, the suiphate must be
dissolved in water, and a quantity of pure pot-
ash in solution must be added ; the magnesia
is then thrown down, and may be separated
by filtration. Or if carbonate of potash be put
into the solution of sulphate of magnesia, car-
bonate of magnesia will then be precipitated,
which may be separated by filtration ; this last
must be exposed to a red heat to drive off the
carbonic acid ; the former need only to be
dried in a gentle heat.

Magnesia is a white, soft powder, possessing
little taste and no smell ; its specific gravity is
said to be 2.3. It operates on vegetable co-
lours like lime and the alkalies. It is infusible
by heat, and very sparingly soluble in water.
According to Kirwan, it requires 7000 times
its weight of water to dissolve it ; I found it
require 16,000 times its weight of water in
one experiment. When exposed to the air,

magnesia, like lime, attracts 1 atom of water
to 1 of magnesia, amounting to about 47 per
cent. by my experience ; it attracts carbonic
acid but very slowly. It does not combine
with any of the situple substances, except per-
haps hydrogen and sulphur. With the acids it
forms neutral salts, which are found frequently
to combine with other salts.

As the sn|phate of magnesia is the ordinary
combination of this earth exhibited as a soluble
salt, it may be of use to have a table shewing
the quantity of real dry sulphate, and of ordi-
nary crystallized sulphate, in given weights or
Measures of solutions of different specific gra-
vities. The table is founded on my own ex-
perience.

3. Baryles.

The earth now denominated barytes, was
discovered by Scheele in 1774. Since then
the labour and experience of several distin-
guished chemists have added much to the
knowledge both of the earth and its com-
pounds ; so that now it may perhaps be said
to be the best understood of all the earths. It
occurs most frequently in combination with
sulphuric acid, the compound being called
sulphate of barytes, formerly ponderous spar,
and is found about mines, particularly of cop-
per. It also occurs in combination with car-
bonic acid, though rarely ; the compound is
denominated carbonate of barytes.

Barytes may be obtained either from the sul-
phate or the carbonate. The former must be
pulverized, mixed with charcoal, and exposed
in a crucible to a red heat for some hours; the
sulphate is thus changed into a sulphuret. This
sulphuret is to be treated with nitric acid,
when the sulphur is thrown down, and the
barytes.combines with the acid ; the acid may
then be driven off by a red heat. and barytes
will remain in the crucible. If the carbonate

--- Page 547 ---
BARYTES. 419

be used, it must be pulverized, mixed with
charcoal, and exposed for some time in a cru-
cible to the heat of a smith’s forge. Boiling
water will then dissolve the pure barytes, leav-
ing the charcoal and carbonate, and upon
cooling, crystals of hydrate of barytes are ob-
tained. The greatest part of the water may
be driven off by heat.

Pure barytes obtained by the former method
is a greyish white body, easily reduced to
powder. It has a harsh and caustic taste, and
if swallowed proves poisoncus. Like lime,
when exposed to the atmosphere, it absorbs
water, and then parts with it for carbonic
acid. It changes certain vegetable blues to
green. Its specific gravity is nearly 4. Ba-
rytes forms various combinations with water,
called Aydrates, which will presently be men-
tioned. It combines with sulphur and phos-
phorus, but not with the other simple sub-
stance. The sulphuret and phosphuret will
be considered under their respective heads.
The weight of the ultimate particle of barytes
can be very nearly approximated, and appears
to be 68, or twice the weight of an atom of
sulphuric acid. This appears from the follow-
ing statement of the proportions of the most
common berytic salts, which have been suc-
cessfully investigated.

The following respectable authorities agree
in assigning 22 per cent. acid to carbonate of
barytes ; namely, Pelletier, Clement, Desor-
mes, Klaproth, and Kirwan; and more re-
cently Mr. Aikin finds 21.67, and Mr. James
Thomson, 21.75 (Nicholson’s Journal, vol. 22
and 23, 1809). The Jast mentioned chemist
finds sulphate of barytes to be 33 acid, and 67
barytes. His conclusion corroborates the pre-
vious ones of Withering, Black, Klaproth,
Kirwan, Bucholz, aud Berthier, who all fix
the acid at or near 33 percent. Vauquelin,
Rose, Berthollet and Thenard. and Clement
and Desormes find $2 or more acid ; and Four-
croy and Aikin, 34. It is very satisfactory to
see the near coincidence in regard to the con-
stitution of this salt ; because it is frequently
made a test of the quantity of sulphuric acid
and of sulphur, Mr. J. Thomson finds 59.3
barytes per cent. in nitrate of barytes, Clement
and Desormes 60, Kirwan 58 and 55 at dif-
ferent trials, and Fourcroy and Vauquelin 50.
These results differ considerably from each
other, and are all below the proportion as-

signed abave ; but it must be observed that
crystallized nitrate of barytes contains water,
and perhaps various quantities of water ac-
cording to the temperature in which it crystal-
lizes ; now, if the atom of nitrate be associ-
ated with 1 atom of water, then the proportion
of barytes per cent. will be 59.6, which nearly
agrees with Thomson, and Clement and De-
sormes ; if with 2 atoms of water, the barytes
will be 55.7 percent. ; if with 3 atoms, then
52.3, &c.—Crystallized muriate of barytes ap-
pears clearly to consist of an atom of dry mu-
rate +2 atoms of water; or 22 acid + 68
barytes + 16 water; this reduced gives 20.8
acia + 64.1 barytes + 15.1 water per cent.—
For, Kirwan finds 20 acid + 64 base + 16
water; Fourcroy, 24 acid + 60 base + 16 wa-
ter; and Aikin, 22.9 acid + 62.5 base + 14.6
water per cent., which agree with each other,
and with the theory as nearly as can be ex-
pected.

Rarytes combines with most acids, and forms
with them neutral salts. In many respects it
appears to he related to the fixed alkalies, only
an weight it is nearly the same as both of them
put together.

Hydrate of Barytes.

When pure barytes, obtained from the ni-
trate by heat, is exposed to the air, or is moist-
ened by water, it combines with it, and that
in various degrees, forming a number of hy-
drates, which have not been sufficiently at-
tended to and discriminated ; much heat is
evolved during the combination : it was mis-
taking the first hydrate of barytes for pure ba-
rytes that caused the uncertainty for some time
in regard to the proportions of the elements of
sulphate of barytes (see page 474). Now, if
an atom of barytes weigh 68, the first hydrate
will weigh 76, to which if 34 sulphuric acid
be added, we shall have an atom of sulphate
of barytes = 102, (for the water is driven off
by the union of the acid and base) ; if then we
conceived the hydrate to be pure barytes, we
should conclude that 76 barytes united to 26
sulphuric acid to form 102 sulphate, which is
very near the former mistaken conclusion of
Thenard and Berthollet. Hence, then, there
is reason to conclude that their barytes, kept
some time in a red heat, was in reality the first
hydrate, or one atom of barytes and one of wa-
ter. When pure barytes is dissolved in boiling
water, a solution is formed of specific gravity

HYDRATE OF SARYTES. §23

exceeding 1.2; on cooling, great part of it
crystallizes ; these crystals are the éwentieth
hydrate, or consist of 1 atom of barytes and 20
of water, or 30 barytes and 70 water per cent. ;
if they are exposed to a heat about 400° or 5000°,
they melt, great part of the water is dissipated,
and a dry whie powder is obtained, which is
the fifth hydrate. In this operation, 228 parts
(= 68 + 20 X 8) are reduced to 108 (= 68 +
5 x 8), or 100 to 47, which is exactly the re-
ductiun obtained experimentally by Dr. Hope.
This dry powder melts below a red heat ; but
I have not been able to find what it would be
reduced to by exposure to a red heat, because
it acquires carbonic acid, even in a crucible,
as Berthollet has observed, almost as fast as it
loses water. My experience on the crystals of
barytes has been limited ; but from the follow-
ing I conclude they are the feventieth hydrate.
1 tock 80 grains cf fresh crystallized barytes,
and dissolved them in 1000 grains of water;
the solution was of the specific gravity 1.024;
this solution took 70 grain measures of test sul-
phuric acid to saturate it, and afforded 36 grains
of dried sulphate of barytes : of this 12 grains
were acid and 24 barytes. Whence we learn,
Ist, that 80 grains of crystals are equal to 24
real barytes, or 228 equal to 68 ; but 228 =
20 X 8+ 68, which shews that 20 atoms cf

water are united to 1 of barytes; 2d, that the
decimals in the second and third places of the
expression for the specific gravity, denote the
quantity of real barytes in 1000 grain measures
of the solution. This last must evidently hold
without any material error in al) the inferior
solutions ; and hence the strength and value of
barytic water may be known by its specific
gravity, an advantage which does not practi-
cally appertain to lime-water. By subsequent
trials, however, I found the quantity of barytes
rather overrated.

The following sketch of a table of the hy-
drate of basytes may have its use, till a more
ample and correet one can be constructed.

its distinguishing properties, were pointed out
by Dr. Hope in an essay read to the Royal
Society of Edinburgh, in 1792, and published
in their Transactions, 1794. Several distin:
guished chemists have since confirmed and ex+
tended these investigations. The Scotch mi«
neral is a carbonate of strontites ; but the earth
has since been found in various parts combined
with sulphuric acid.

Strontites is obtained from the sulphate or
carbonate of strontites, hy the same processes
as barytes from the like compounds ; indeed,
it bears so close a resemblance to barytes, both
in its free and combined state, as to have been
confounded with it. Strontites has much the
same acrid taste as barytes ; but it is not poi-
sonous ; it is less soluble in water than barytes ;
it has the property of giving a red or purple
colour to flame, for which purpose the nitrate
or muriate may be dissolved in alcohol, or ap-
plied to the wick of a candle. The weight of
the atom of strontites is deducible from the sa'ts
which it forms with the more commion acids to
be 46. Thus,

526 EARTHS.

Dr. Hope, Pelletier, and Klaproth find 30
per cent. of acid in the carbonate. Klaproth,
Clayfield, Henry, and Kirwan find 42 per cent.
acid in the sulphate. Kirwan finds the crys-
tallized nitrate to contain 31.07 acid, 36.2!
base, and $2.72 water; which I presume de-
notes 1 atom of acid, 1 of base, and 5 of wa-
ter; that is, 38 acid + 46 base + 40 water ;
this reduced, would give 30.6 acid, $7.1 base,
and 32.3 water percent. which very nearly
agrees with his experience. Taking the dry
salt, his results would give 46.2 acid, and 53.8
base. Vauquelin finds the nitrate to contain
48.4 acid, 47.6 base, and 4 water; but this
constitution cannot be correct: Neither can
Richter’s analysis, which gives 51.4 acid and
water, and 48.6 base.— Dry muriate of stron-
tites, according to Kirwan, consists of 31 acid,
and 69 base; but Wauquelin states $9 acid,
and 61 base ; the former, without doubt, is
nearer the truth.

Hydrate of Strontites, When water is put
to pure strontites, it becomes hot and swells, like
lime and barytes, and falls into dry powder.
This powder seems to be the first hydrate ;
whence, 46 parts of strontites will take 8 of
water to form this combination ; but if more
water be added, the hydrate crystallizes.
These crystals appear to be the 12th hydrate ;

--- Page 555 ---
ALUMINE, 527

that is, they are constituted of 1 atom of stron-
tites and 12 of water = 46 + 96 = 142, or 32
strontites + 68 water per cent. agreeably to
the experience of Dr. Hope. Water dissolves
about +3,th of its weight of pure strontites in
the temperature of 60°, or {sth of its weight
of the crystals; the specific gravity of the solu-
tion is nearly 1.008. But boiling water dis-
solves about half its weight of the crystals.
Whence it appears that strontites is much less
soluble than barytes, and much more soluble
than lime. The specific gravity of the crystals
of strontites is rightly determined by Hassen-
fratz to be nearly 1.46. Strontian water may
be used for the same purposes as lime-water,
or barytic water.

Strontites combines with most of the acids to
form neutral salts. It also combines with sul-
phur and phosphorus.

5. Alumine, or Argil.

The earth denominated aiumine, constitutes
a great portion of common clay ; but this last
isa mixture of two or more earths with iron,
&c., and therefore cannot be exhibited as pure
alumine. The earth may be obtained pure
from a common well known salt, called alum,

--- Page 556 ---
528 BARTHs,

which is constituted of sulphate of potash and
sulphate of alumine combined together, with
a portion of water. A quantity of alum is to
be dissolved in 10 times its weight of water ;
to this a quantity of liquid ammonia is to be
added ; the sulphuric acid seizes the ammonia,
and lets fall the alumine, which may be scpa-
rated from the liquid by filtration; and then
exposed to a red heat.

Alumine thus obtained is a fine white earth,
spongy, and adhesive when moistened ; it has
neither taste nor smell ; it is said to have the
specific gravity, 2. When mixed with water,
it forms a mass which is the basis of earthen
ware, and capable of receiving any figure. In
this case, by the application of great heat, it
becomes excessively hard, and loses in part,
or wholly, its adhesive quality. Pure alamine
bears the highest heat of a furnace without un-
dergoing any change.

Alumine does not form any known combi-
nation with oxygen, hydrogen, charcoal, sul-
phur, or phosphorus ; but it combines with
the alkalies, with most of the earths, and with
several metallic oxides. It combines too with
many of the acids, but forms in most cases un-
crystallizable salts. It possesses a strong affi-
nity for vegetable colouring matter, and hence
its great importance in the arts of dyeing and

--- Page 557 ---
ALUMINE, 4Qg

printing, in which it is employed to fix the
colour on the cloth,

The weight of an aiom of alumine is not so
easily determined as that of the preceding
earths and alkalies; partly because the salts
which it forms with the acids are not crystal-
lizable, and partly because they have not had
a proportionate share of attention paid to them,
The only salt with alumine which has been
careiully analyzed is the triple compound, or
alum ; an acquaintance with the constitution
and properties of this salt is of great importance
to its manufacturer, and to the various artists
to whom it is of indispensible utility.

The experience of Chaptal, Vauquelin, and
of Thenard and Roard (An, de Chimie, vol.
22, 50, and 59, or Nicholson’s Journal, vol.
18) shews that the alum of all countries is very
nearly the same in its constitution and qualities,
that it contains 33 per cent. sulphuric acid, 11
or 12 aiumine, 8 or 9 potash, and 47 water.
All the authors I have mentioned do not agree,
it is true, in these numbers ; but the differences
‘are more in appearance than reality. Vau-
quelin obtains 95 sulphate of barytes from 100
alum, but Thenard and Roard obtain 100,
The last mentioned chemists adop: only 26
per cent. acid in sulphate of barytes ; whereas
it is now universally allowed there are about

--- Page 558 ---
530 EARTHS.

33 per cent. acid in that salt. Mr. James
Thomson, I am informed, finds nearly 100 per
cent. sulphate of barytes. This result I adopt
as the most correct, and it is also the most
recent. Vauquelin finds 48} water in alum;
this is more than is generally found, and ac-
counts in some degree for his obcaining less
sulphate of barytes. Chaptal finds 47 per cent.
water in English alum, with which my expe-
rience accords. Vauquelin finds 10.5 alumine,
Thenard and Koard, 12.5 per cent. Mr.
Tennant of Glasgow, who favoured me with
an analysis, finds 11.2 alumine in the alum
manufactured there. This last chemist finds
15 per cent. sulphate of potash, which is the
same as Thenard and Roard’s nearly, 15.7.
Now, as 34 acid + 42 potash, have been
shewn to constitute 76 sulphate, 15 must con-
tain 6.7 acid and 8.3 potash. Collecting these
results then, it appears that alum may be said
to consist of,

33 sulphuric acid.
11.7 alumine.

8.3 potash.
47 water.

100

--- Page 559 ---
ALUMINE. 531

Of the 33 sulphuric acid, it must be recol-
lected that 6.7 parts belong to the potash ; that
is, th of the whole; the remainder, or 4ths,
belong to the alumine. Hence, then, were
there only 5 atoms of sulphuric acid in a mole-
cule of alum, 1 atom would appertain to an
atom of potash, and the other 4 atoms to as
many of alumine, provided the acid and alumine
unite one to one, which we are to presume
till sufficient reason appear to the contrary.
It should seem, then, that an atom of alum is
constituted of one of sulphate of potash in the
centre, and 4 atoms of sulphate df alumine
around it, forming a square. But $3 —6.7
= 26.3 acid to 11.7 alumine ; and 26.3 : 11.7: .
$4: 15, the weight of an atom of alumine.
Dry alum must, therefore, be 5 X 34 + 42 +
4X 15= 272; but as this is found combined
with water in the state of common alum, it
will be satisfactory to know how many atoms
of water are attached to one atom of dry alum:
for this purpose, we have 53 : 47: : 272: 241
=the weight of water; this, divided by 3,
gives the number of atoms = $0. Hence, an
atom of common alum consists of,

1 atom of sulphate of potash == 76==percent. 15

| atoms of sulphate of alumine
And 30 atoms of water.

332 EARTHS.

A saturated solution of alum in water, at the
temperature 60°, is of the specific gravity 1.048,
and is constituted of 1 atom of dry alum and
600 of water ; or the alum has 20 times the
quantity of water that the crystals contain.
The specific gravity of alum itself is about 1.71;
and by means of heat, solutions of it in water
may be obtained of any inferior specific gra-
vity ; at least, I have had a solution, which,
when hot, was 1.57.

Alumine does not combine with carbonic
acid; but it combines with the nitric and mu-
riatic acids ; it would, therefore, be desirable
that the weight of an atom of alumine should
be investigated from these last combinations,
as well as from the sulphate. No author that
I know has given the proportion of elements
in nitrate of alumine; and in muriate of
alumine Bucholz determines equal parts of acid
and base, and Wenzel 28 acid to 72 base; so
that no confidence can be placed inthem. I
determined the proportions of these salts as
follows: 100 grains of alum were dissolved in
water; the alumine was precipitated by 156
measures, more or less, of test ammonia, (.97),
care being taken that the aluminous solution
was saturated with ammonia, and that none
was superabundant ; the liquid was then well
agitated, and immediately divided into three

--- Page 561 ---
ALUMINE, 533

equal portions. It was then found that each
of these portions took 52 measures of the test
acids; namely, the sulphuric, the nitric, and
the muriatic respectively, to dissolve the float-
ing alumine, and to clear the solutions which
were afterwards found to be free from uncom-
bined acids. Hence, the proportions of the
salts are deduced as under :

Acid, Bare.

Nitrate ———- —— 71.7 + 28.3 —— —— 38:15
Muriate —— —— 59.5 + 40.5 —— —— 22:15

It will be proper here to notice an opinion
which Vauquelin supported in his essay in
1797, but which is not adverted to in his suc-
ceeding essay in 180+, nor in the one of The-
nard and Roard in 1806: I mean the opinion
that alum consists of the supersulphate of alu-
mine and sulphate of potash. If this be true,
then the atom of alumine must weigh 30, be-
cause 2 atoms of sulphuric acid unite to 1 of
alumine. The opinion appears to me without
support. When a solution of alum is put to
the blue test, it changes it to red ; but this is
not a proof of excess of acid where the base of
the salt has a strong affinity for colouring mat-
ter ; there is probably a true decomposition of
the salt, or perhaps the colouring matter forms

--- Page 562 ---
534 EARTHS.

a triple compound with the salt. That no
uncombined acid accompanies alum is certain,
because the least portion of alkali decomposes
it. Besides, a red heat drives off half of the
acid at least from supersalts ; but alum bears a
red heat without losing a sensible portion of
acid. From the experiment related above, it
appears that the sulphuric, the nitric, and the
muriatic acid tests are of equal efficacy in satu-
rating alumine. Are these all supersalts? If
so, why does not half the acid im each case
neutralize the earth, and form a simple salt ?—
But it is said if alumine be boiled in a solution
of alum, the alumine combines with the alum,
and falls down an insoluble, neutral salt.
Vauquelin asserts he has made the experi-
ment; but he mentions no proportions, nor
does he point out the time requisite to produce
the effect. With a view to this subject, I pre-
cipitated the alumine from a measure of satu-
rated solution of alum at 60° (about 100 grains
of alum) by the necessary quantity of ammonia ;
to this liquid, which was found neutral, still
containing the alumine in suspension, I put
another measure of the same solution of alum,
and boiled the whole for 10 minutes in a glass
vessel ; it was then set aside to cool, and fil-
tered ; the liquid was not much diminished in
specific gravity, and required nearly the same

--- Page 563 ---
ALUMIXE, 535

quantity of ammonia to saturate it, and af-
forded the same quantity of alumine as the first
measure. Apprehending the sulphate of am-
monia present might influence the result, I
next put the dry pulverized alumine from 100
grains of alum into a solution of 100 grains of
alum in water, and in another experiment the
moist recently filtered alumine, and boiled the
whole for 10 minutes; the water evaporated was
restored, and the liquor filtered ; it was of the
same specific gravity as at first, tasted equally
aluminous, and the precipitate collected and
dried, weighed just the same as before. These
facts lead me to doubt concerning the existence
of this aluan saturated with its earth, asthe earlier
chemists called it, But supposing the existence
of a combination of sulphuric acid with twice
the quantity of alumine, I know no reason why
it should not be constituted of 1 atom of acid
and 2 of alumine. Hence, I conclude the
weight of an atom of alumine above stated isa
fair deduction.

The French chemists seem to have proved
that the presence of even a very small portion
of sulphate of iron in alum is very injurious in
some of its uses in dyeing, Sec.

Hydrate of Alumine. Saussure, in the 52d
vol. of the Journal de Physique, observes, that
alumine is precipitated from its solution, in

536 EARTHS.

two very different states, according to circum.
stances; the one he calls spongy, and the other
gelatinous alumine ; they both retain 58 parts
per cent. of water, when dried in common
summer heat ; the former parts with the whole
of its water at a red heat; but the latter only
loses 48 per cent. at the highest temperature.
There may be some doubt as to the accuracy of
these facts ; but it would seem probable that
alumine, at the ordinary temperature, retains 2
atoms of water, or 15 parts alumine hold 16 of
water ; this would allow 52 per cent. loss
by a red heat. The subject deserves further
attention,

6. Silex.

The earth denominated siler, is found abun-
dantly in a great many stones; it is almost pure
in flint, rock crystal, and others ; but of stones
in general it only constitutes a part, being
found in combination with one or more of the
other earths, or with metals, &c. It is also
found in small particles in the form of white
sand. The most distinguishing feature of this
earth is its melting along with either of the
fixed alkalies, and forming with them that
beautiful and well known compound, glass.
The specific gravity of flint and rock crystal is
usually about 2.65. After being heated red

--- Page 565 ---
SILEX, 537

hot for some time, flint may be pulverized in
an iron mortar, and formsa white earth, which
may be regarded as silex sufficiently pure for
most purposes. It forms a harsh, gritty pow-
der, which does not cohere nor form a paste
with water like clay. It is insoluble in water
in any sensible degree. It is infusible by heat,
unless at an extremely high degree. To obtain
silex in a pure state, a mixture of sulphuric
acid and fluate of lime must be distilled in glass
vessels, or along with pulverized flint, when
superfluate of silex is produced in an elastic
state ; the gas may be received over water, on
the surface of which a crust of fluate of silex is
formed ; this crust being removed by filtration
or otherwise, the clear liquor is to be saturated
with ammonia, when pure silex is thrown
down. When dried in a red heat, it formsa
fine white powder. The common mode pre-
scribed to obtain pure silex gives pure glass, as
will presently be explained. It is remarkable,
that sulphuric acid, poured on fluate of silex,
expels the fluoric acid in fumes, though it does
not combine with the silex.

Silex combines with the two fixed alkalies,
with most of the earths, and with metallic
oxides ; but with few of the acids immedi-
ately, except the fluoric ; when joined to an
alkali, it may be united to several of the acids,

--- Page 566 ---
538 EARTHS.

forming triple salts. It seems not to combine
with oxygen, hydrogen, or the other combus-
tibles, nor with ammonia.

The fixed alkalies may each be combined
with silex in two proportions. In order to
forma glass, one part of silex and one of fine
dry carbonate of soda may be mixed together ;
but if potash is used, then 14 parts will be re-
quired. Ifthe other or soluble compound is
wanted, then double the quantities of alkali
must be used, or 2 parts af soda and 3 of pot-
ash. A strong red heat in each case is neces-
sary to form a complete union of the principles ;
the fused mass gives out the carbonic acid of
the alkalies, and when poured out immediately
becomes glass ; but: when the double quantity
of alkali is used, the glass is deliquescent, and
may be completely dissolved in water. This
last may be catled supersodiuretted or superpo-
tasiuretted silez, and the former sodiuretted or
potasiurelted silex. When an acid is dropped
into a.solution of superpotasiuretted silex, a
white precipitate is immediately formed, which
is potasiuretted silex, or common glass, and
not silex, as has hitherto been supposed. Yor,
1. The heated precipitate, I find, weighs about
ds of the red hot potasiuretted silex, whereas
the silex is only about 4d of the compound ; 2.
the acid requisite to throw down the preci-

SILEX. 538

pitate, is only half of that which the alkali in
the compound would require for its saturation ;
3. the precipitate, dried in a moderate red
heat, is fusible into glass by the blow-pipe ;
and, 4, as the acids do not take the alkali
from glass, they ought not to take more alkali
from superpotasiuretted silex than what would
reduce it to common glass.

It is more difficult to find the weight of an
atom of silex than that of any other of the pre-
vious earths, because it enters into combination
with only one of the acids, and the proportions
have not yet been ascertained. [ have, how-
ever, succeeded pretty well by investigating its
relations with potash, lime, and barytes. Hav-
ing obtained a quantity of superpotasiuretted
silex without any excess of alkali; that is,
which afforded a precipitate with the least por-
tion of acid (for if the alkali be in excess, acid
may be added without any precipitation), 1
precipitated a given weight of the dried com-
pound previously in water, by sulphuric acid
in excess ; the precipitate was heavy and bulky ;
after remaining on the filter for some time, it
resembled a mass of over-boiled potatoe ; the
water being forced out by pressure, a white
subtance remained, which easily left the filter,
and when dried in a low red heat, Jeft a harsh
gritty powder, nearly 3ds of the weight of the

--- Page 568 ---
540 EARTHS.

compound. Again, test sulphuric acid was
slowly added to the solution, of a given weight
of the dry compound in water ; as soon as the
mixture manifested acid to the test liquid, it
was considered as saturated. The whole acid
added was found to be sufficient to saturate a
weight of pure alkali nearly equal to 3d of that
of the dry compound. These experiments
rendered it obvious that only one half of the
alkali was engaged by the acid, the other half
remaining with the silex; and the conversion
of the precipitate into. glass by the blow-pipe
confirmed the conclusion. It remained, then,
to determine which of the two combinations
of alkali and silex was the most simple. As a
part of the alkali is easily drawn from one com-
pound, and difficultly from the other, the
former must be supposed two atoms of alkali
to one of silex, and the latter one to one.
From this it should seem, that the weight of
an atom of silex is nearly the same as that of an
atom of potash; and the near agreement of
the specific gravities of these two bodies, is an
argument in favour of the conclusion.
Superpotasiuretted silex exhibited remark-
able results with lime and barytes. One hun-
dred measures of the solution, containing 18
grains dry, were saturated with 5000 grains of
lime water, containing 6 grains of lime; the

--- Page 569 ---
SILEX: 541

precipitate, filtered and dried in a low red
heat, was 19 grains. The residuary liquid re-
quired 27 grains of test muriatic acid to sa-
turate it; whereas, the like quantity of lime
water took 54 grains. Here, then, it appears
that each atom of the superpotasiuretted silex
must have been decomposed into one atom of
potash, which remained in the liquid, and one
atom of potasiuretted silex, which united to
two atoms of lime, and the compound was pre-
cipitated. That the matter in the liquid was
potash, and not lime, was proved by carbonic
acid ; and the test muriatic acid shewed that
every atom of potash in the liquid took the
place of two atoms of lime. The case was
different with barytes. One hundred measures
of the solution, containing 18 grains dry, were
saturated with 850 measures of 1.0115 barytic
water, containing 9 dry barytes. The resi-
duary liquid took 28 test acid to saturate it,
and the precipitate dried in a red heat was 20
grains. Here it is evident that one atom of
barytes had detached one of potash from the
compound, and taken its place ; consequently,
the residue of liquid required the same quan-
tity of acid as the barytic water, and the pré-
cipitate was a triple compound of silex, pot+
ash, and barytes ; one atom of each, consisting

--- Page 570 ---
542 EARTHS.

probably ot 9 parts of barytes, 54 silex, and
5. potash.

Upon the whole, I am inclined to believe
that one atom of silex weighs nearly 45 times
that of hydrogen.

Silex combines with alumine by heat, and
the compound forms hard infusible bodies, such
as porcelain, earthen ware, bricks, 8c.

7. Yttria.

This earth is found at Ytterby, in Sweden.
it constitutes a portion of the mineral called
gadolinite, first analyzed by Gadolin, and of
that called ytrotantalite, both found in the
same mine. The earth may be obtained by
dissolving the pulverized mineral in a mixture
of nitric and muriatic acids ; the liquor poured
off is then evaporated to dryness, the residuum
dissolved in water. If ammonia be now added,
the earth is precipitated. It is obtained in the
form of a white powder, said to be of the spe-
cific gravity 4.84. It is infusible by heat, and
insoluble in water : but it forms salts with se-
veral of the acids ; and these salts have mostly
a sweet taste, and are in some instances co-
loured. They resemble the m-tallic salts in
many particulars. According to Klaproth, the


--- Page 571 ---
GLUCINE, 543

hydrate of yttria, a dry powder, contains 32
per cent. water; this would imply that the
atom of yttria weighs 18, 36, or 53, according
as it is the first, second, or third hydrate ; but
he finds the carbonate of yttria to be 18 acid,
55 yttria, and 27 water: now, supposing the
carbonate to be 1 atom of acid, 1 of earth, and
3 of water, and that the acid and water weigh
45, then the atom of earth is deduced to be
53; and this conclusion agrees with the pre-
ceding one, which supposes the hydrate to be
the third. The great specific gravity of the
earth countenances the notion of the atom be-
ing heavy ; but we cannot rely upon the above
determination till it is supported by more va-
rious experiments.

8. Glucine.

The earth called glucine (from the sweet-
tasted salts which it forms with acids) is ob-
tained chiefly from two minerals, the beryl
and the emerald, These minerals are consti-
tuted of silex, alumine, and glucine ; the two
former being abstracted by the usual processes,
there remains the glucine, a soft white powder,
adhering to the tongue, but without taste or
smell, and infusible by heat. Its specific gra-
yity is said to be 2.97. It is insoluble in wa-

--- Page 572 ---
544 EARTHS.

ter. This earth combines with the acids, with
liquid fixed alkalies, and with liquid carbonate
of ammonia. In the last case it resembles
yttria, but is much more soluble than that earth
in carbonate of ammonia. Glucine has consi-
derable resemblance in its properties both to
alumine and yttria.

We have not data sufficient to find the
weight of an atom of glucine; but from the
experiments of Vauquelin on the carbonate of
glucine (Annal. de Chimie, tom. 26, pages
160 and 172) it should seem to weigh nearly
30, or twice the weight of alumine. It is re~
markable, too, that the analysis of the beryl,
and of the emerald, give nearly the same quan-
tity of alumine and glucine, which indicates
thar the weight of an atom of the latter is ei-
ther equal to that of the former, or some mul-
tiple of it.

9. Bircone.

The zircon or jargon, and the hyacinth, are
two precious stones found chiefly in Ceylon.
These contain a peculiar carth which has re-
ceived the name of zircone. It may be ob-
tained thus: Let one part of zircon in powder,
be fused with 6 parts of potash; then let the
mass be diffused through a portion of water,

--- Page 573 ---
ZIRCONE. 545

which will dissolve the potash and its combi-
nations, and leave a residuum. This residuum
must be dissolved in muriatic acid, and potash
must be added, which will precipitate the zir-
cone. It isa fine white powder, insipid, and
somewhat harsh to the feel. When violently
heated, it is converted into a kind of porcelain,
very hard, and of the specific gravity 4.35.
Zircone is not soluble in’ water, but it retains
+ or + of its weight of water when dried in the
air, and assumes the appearance of gum arabic.
Zircone is not soluble in liquid alkalies, but it
is in the alkaline carbonates; it adheres to se-
veral of the metallic oxides. Zircone unites
with acids, and forms with them salts, many
of which are insoluble in water, but others are
very soluble. They have an astringent taste,
resembling some of the metallic salts.

As the salts of zircone have not yet been
formed with sufficient care to ascertain the
ratio of their constituent principles, we can not
exactly determine the weight of an atom of this
earth. Vauquelin finds 44 carbonic acid and
water and 56 zircone in carbonate of zircone ;
but, unfortunately, he has not given the acid
separately from the water. Allowing the ac-
curacy of the above, and supposing the car-
bonate to contain 1 atom of water, the weight
of an atom of zircone will be 34; but if we

--- Page 574 ---
546 EARTHS.

suppose 2 atoms of water, then the atom of
earth comes out 45. This last I judge to be
nearest the truth. It is remarkable, that the
hyacinth contains 32 parts of silex and 64 of
zircone, which, according to the above con-
clusion, corresponds to 1 atom of silex and 2
of zircone, a constitution by no means impro-
bable. Upon this principle, the gummy hy-
dsate above mentioned, may be 2 atoms of
water and 1} of zircone, or 16 water + 45
zircone,

>PO«-

As it is nearly two years since the printing
of this second part commenced, it may be ex-
pected that in the rapid progress of chemical
investigation, some addition has, in the in-
terval, been made to the stock of facts and ob-
servations relating to the more early subjects
herein discussed. The ground upon which I
determine the weights of the ultimate particles
of the metals, has not yet been entered upon.
This will occupy a Jeading place in a second
volume, when the metallic oxides and sul-
phurets come to be considered. It will be
observed, that I have seen reason to change
some of the metallic weights which were
given in the first part ; and it is probable, that
in our future investigations these may be again
changed ; this will depend upon the precision
with which the proportions of the elements of
the metallic oxides, sulphurets and salts, shall
be obtained. The identity of tantalium and
columbium seems to have been ascertained by

Dr. Wollaston. Mr. Davy, and the French
chemists Gay Lussac and Thenard, have fur-
nished a number of facts and observations on
various subjects, resulting from their applica-
tion of the new metals, potasium and sodium,
and Voltaic electricity, to chemical investiga-
tions. When the mind is ardently engaged in
prosecuting experimental enquiries, of a new
and extraordinary kind, it is not to be ex-
pected that new theoretic views can be exa-
mined in all their relations; and formed so as
to be consistent with all the well known and
established facts of chemistry ; nor that the
facts themselves can be ascertained with that
precision which long experience, an acquaint-
ance with the instruments, and the defects to
which they are liable, and a comparison of
like observations made by different persons,
are calculated to produce. This may appear
to be a sufficient apology for the differences ob-
served in the results of the above celebrated
chemists, and for the opposition, and some-
times extravagance, of their views.

All the phenomena of combustion are exhi
bited by heating potasium in fluorie acid gas
(superfluate of silex) ; though this would seem
to intimate that the gas contains oxygen, yet,
as Mr. Davy properly observes, heat and light


--- Page 579 ---
APPENDIX, 551

are merely the results of the intense agency of
combination. It is remarkable that hydrogen
is given out, yet not so much as would be
given by the action of potasium on water ; it is
variable, and amounts generally to less than
3th of that quantity. Mr. Davy and the
French chemists agree in the belief of a decom-
position of the acid ; but it is doubtful whether
the hydrogen is from the potasium or the acid.
The fact, I have observed, page 285, of the
diminution of a mixture of hydregen and fluoric
acid gas by electricity, is one of the strongest
in favour of the notion that the acid gas con-
tains oxygen.

Muriatic acid has been a great object of in-
vestigation. Mr. Davy’s ideas on this subject,
in his Electrochemical Researches, 1808, were,
that the acid gas contains water in a combined
state ; or, to use my own phraseology, that an
atom of real muriatic acid combined with one
of water, formed one of the acid gas; hence,
in burning potasium in the gas, the potasium
decomposed the water, the hydrogen was li-
berated, and the oxygen joined to the potasium
to form potash, with which the real or dry
acid immediately united. This conclusion was
plausible ; but it was truly astonishing to see
the French chemists draw the same conclusion

--- Page 580 ---
552 APPENDIX,

from their views of the subject. They should
have viewed muriatic acid gas as the pure acid,
which combined with the potash of the pota-
sium, and liberated its hydrogen. Mr. Davy
has recently written an essay on the oxymu-
riatic and muriatic acids, with a copy of which
he has just favoured me ; in this, he discards
his former opinion of the gaseous combination
of acid and water, and adopts another, that
muriatic acid gas is a pure elastic fluid, result-
ing from the union of hydrogen with oxymu-
riatic acid, which last he conceives to be a
simple substance. This notion agrees so far
with mine, as to make hydrogen the base of
muriatic acid ; but I cannot adopt his consti-
tution of the acid. Mr. Davy now considers
the hydrogen liberated, by the combustion of
potasium in muriatic acid gas, as proceeding
from the decomposed acid, and the new com-
pound an ozymuriate of potasium. "The expla-
nation I prefer is, that the hydrogen proceeds
from the potasium, and the undecomposed acid
gas unites to the potash.

As to oxymuriatic acid, Gay Lussac and
Thenard have reported some very striking and
unexpected propertics of it which they have
discovered. They assert, that dry oxymuriatic
acid gas was not decomposed by sulphurous

--- Page 581 ---
APPENDIX. 553

acid gas, nitrous oxide, carbonic oxide, nor even
nitrous gas, when these were dry ; but that it
was immediately decomposed by them if water
was present. These may appear to them to
be facts ; but certainly they are too important,
and some of them too difficultly ascertained, to
be believed merely upon the assertion of any
one. By what means were they found? What
was the structure of the apparatus, the quantity
of gases operated upon, the time they were al-
Jowed to be in contact, the means employed to
investigate the results, &c. &c.? To answer
all these enquiries satisfactorily, would require
a volume in detail; yet, Gay Lussac and The-
nard have not said one word. Now, we know
that the facts respecting the mixtures of these
gases over water, are of as above stated, Mr.
Davy observes, (Researches, page 250) that
“oxygenated muriatic acid and nitrous oxide
«© were mingled in a water ap; aratus ; there
“was a slight appearance of condensation ;
“ but this was most probably owing to absorp-
“tion by the water; on agitation, the oxy-
* genated muriatic acid was absorbed, and the
“ greater part of the nitrous oxide remained un-
“altered.” I have repeatedly mixed carbonic
oxide and nitrous gas with oxymuriatic acid in
a water apparatus; the former mixture ex-

--- Page 582 ---
554 APPENDIX,

hibits no signs of chemical union for several
seconds ; afterwards, if the sun shine upon it,
chemical action commences, and continues
some\vhat slower than that of oxygen and ni-
trous gas ; but if the mixture be put in the
dark, it will remain for days, I believe, with-
out any change. The latter mixture, or nitrous
gas and oxymuriatic acid, in equal measures,
over water, produces an instantaneous union,
much more rapid than that of oxygen and _ni-
trous gas, and which to all appearance seems
independent upon the water. Now, if these
simple experiments give such different results
in different hands, what may we expect of the
conplex experiments, where the gases are pre-
viously dried, and then mixed in vessels quite
free from mercury and water, and lastly ex-
amined after such mixture has taken place,
regard being still had to the effects which mer-
cury and water have, or are supposed to have,
upon such mixtures ?

Mr. Davy has given several experiments to
shew that oxymuriatic acid combines with hy-
drogen to produce muriatic acid ; but none of
them appears to me decisive. When equal
measures of hydrogen and oxymuriatic acid
were introduced into an exhausted vessel, and
fired by an electric spark, the result was a


--- Page 583 ---
APPENDIS. 553

slight vapour, and a condensation of ty to 4's
of the volume, the gas remaining being mu-
tiatic acid. This fact, if it can be relied upon,
is favourable to the notion it is to support ; L
should have expected a condensation of 4 or +
of the total volume on the common hypothesis ;
if the author had described the apparatus and
quantity of gases submitted to the experiment,
with tie mode of determining the quantity
and quality of the residual gas, it would have
assisted in any future enquiry onthe subject ;
it is certainly an important experiment. Mr.
Davy allows the hyperoxymuriate of potash
to abound with oxygen. He supposes the
oxygen to be attracted by the potasium, or the
potash, rather than by the oxymuriatic acid.
The facts appear to me to draw the other way
much more powerfully. We find oxymuriatie
acid in conjunction with much oxygen, in se-
veral other salts, but potash no where, except
when joined to this acid. .
Some observations on nitric acid, and the
other compounds of azote and oxygen, have
been'made by Gay Lussac, in the 2d vol. of
the Memoires d’Arcueil. He contends that
one measure of oxygenous gas unites to two
measures of nitrous gas to form nitric acid, and
to three measures to form nitrous acid. Now

--- Page 584 ---
556 APPENDIX.

I have shewn, page 328, that 1 measure of
oxygen may be combined with 1.3 of nitrous
gas, or with 3.5, or with any intermediate
quantity whatever, according to circumstances,
which he seents to aliow ; what, then, is the
nature of the combinations below 2, and above
3, of nitrous gas? No answer is given to this ;
but the opinion is founded upon an hypothesis
that all elastic fluids combire in equal measures,
or in measures that have some simple relation
one to another, as 1 to 2, 1 to3, 2 to 3, &c.
In fact, his notion of measures is analogous to
mine of atoms ; and if it could be proved that
all elastic fluids have the same number of atoms
in the saine volume, or numbers that are as 1,
2,3, &e. the two hypotheses would be the
same, except that mine is universal, and his
applies only to elastic fluids. Gay Lussac
could not but see (page 188, Part 1. of this
work) that a similar hypothesis had been enter-
tained by me, and-abandoned as untenable ;
however, as he has revived the notion, I shall
make a few observations upon it, though I do
not doubt but he will soon see its inadequacy.
Nitrous gas is, according to Gay Lussac,
constituted of equal measures of azote and oxy-
geo, which, when combined, occupy the same
volume as when free. Ile quotes Davy, who


--- Page 585 ---

found 44.05 azote, and 53.95 oxygen by
weight, in nitrous gas, He converts these
into volumes, and finds them after the rate of
100 azote to 108.9 oxygen. There is, how-
ever, a mistake in this; if properly reduced,
it gives 100 azote to 112 oxygen, taking the
specific gravities according to Biot and Arago.
But that Davy has overrated the oxygen 12
per cent. he shews by burning potasium in ni-
trous gas, when 100 measures afforded just 50
of azote. The degree of purity of the nitrous
gas, and the pafticulars of the experiment, are
not mentioned. This one result is to stand
against the mean of three experiments of Davy,
(see page 318) and may or may not be more
correct, as hereafter shall appear. Dr. Henry’s
analysis of ammonia embraces that of nitrous
gas also ; he finds 100 measures of ammonia
require 120 of nitrous gas for their saturation.
Now this will apply to Gay Lussac’s theory in.
a very direct manner ; for, according to him,
ammonia is formed of 1 measure of azote and
3 of hydrogen, condensed into a volume of 2;
it follows, then, that 100 ammonia require 75
oxygen to saturate the hydrogen; hence, 120
nitrous gas should contain 75 oxygen, or 100
should contain 62.5, instead of 50. Here
either the theory of Gay Lussac, or the expe-

--- Page 586 ---

rience of Dr. Henry, must give results wide of
th. truth. In regard to ammonia too, it may
farther be added, that neither is the rate of
azote to hydrogen 1 to 3, nor is the volume of
ammonia doubled by decomposition, according
to the experiments of Berthollet, Davy, and
Henry, made with the most scrupulous atten-
tion. to accuracy, to which may be added my
own.—There is another point of view in
which this theory of Gay Lussac is unfortunate,
in regard to ammonia and nitrous gas; 1 mea-
sure of azote with 3 of hydrogen, forms 2 of
ammonia; and 1 measure of azote with 1 of
oxygen, forms 2 of nitrous gas: now, accord-
ing to a well established principle in che-
mistry, 1 measure of oxygen ought to combine
with 3 of hydrogen, or with one half as much,
or twice as much; but no one of these com-
binations takes place. If Gay Lussac adopt
my conclusions, namely, that 100 measures of
azote require about 230 hydrogen to form am-
monia (page 433), and that 100 azote require
about 120 oxygen to form nitrous gas (page
331), he will perceive that the hydrogen of the
former would unite to the oxygen of the latter,
and form water, leaving no excess of either,
further than the unavoidable errors of expe-
timents might produce ; and thus the great


--- Page 587 ---
APPENDIX, 559

chemical law would be preserved. The truth
is, I believe, that gases do not unite in equal or
exact measures in any one instance ; when
they appear to do so, it is owing to the inac-
curacy of our experiments. In no case, per-
haps, is there a nearer approach to mathema-
tical exactness, than in that of 1 measure of
oxygen to 2 of hydrogen ; but here, the most
exact experiments I have ever made, gave 1.97
hydrogen to 1 oxygen.

T shall close this subject, by presenting two
tables of the elements ot elastic fluids ; they
are collected principally from the results already
given.in detail, with a few smallalterations or
corrections ; the utility of them to practical
chemistry will be readily recognised,
