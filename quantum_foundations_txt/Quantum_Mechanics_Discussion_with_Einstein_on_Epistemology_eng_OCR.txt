DISCUSSION WITH EINSTEIN ON EPISTEMOLOGICAL
PROBLEMS IN ATOMIC PHYSICS

Niecs BouR

Originally published in Albert Einstein: Philosopher-Scientist, P. A.
Schilpp, ed., pp. 200-41 The Library of Living Philosophers,
Evanston (1949).

When invited by the Editor of the series, "Living Philosophers,”
to write an article for this volume in which contemporary scientists
are honouring the epoch-making contributions of Albert Einstein to
the progress of natural philosophy and are acknowledging the
indebtedness of our whole generation for the guidance his genius
has given us, | thought much of the best way of explaining how
much | owe to him for inspiration. In this connection, the many
occasions through the years on which | had the privilege to discuss
with Einstein epistemological problems raised by the modern
development of atomic physics have come back vividly to my mind
and | have felt that | could hardly attempt anything better than to
give an account of these discussions which, even if no complete
concord has so far been obtained, have been of greatest value and
stimulus to me. | hope also that the account may convey to wider
circles an impression of how essential the open-minded exchange
of ideas has been for the progress in a field where new experience
has time after time demanded a reconsideration of our views.

From the very beginning the main point under debate has been the
attitude to take to the departure from customary principles of
natural philosophy characteristic of the novel development of
physics which was initiated in the first year of this century by
Planck's discovery of the universal quantum of action. This
discovery, which revealed a feature of atomicity in the laws of
nature going far beyond the old doctrine of the limited divisibility of
matter, has indeed taught us that the classical theories of physics
are idealizations which can be unambiguously applied only in the
limit where all actions involved are large compared with the
quantum. The question at issue has been whether the renunciation
of a causal mode of description of atomic processes involved in the
endeavours to cope with the situation should be regarded as a
temporary departure from ideals to be ultimately revived or whether
we are faced with an irrevocable step towards obtaining the proper
harmony between analysis and synthesis of physical phenomena.
To describe the background of our discussions and to bring out as
clearly as possible the arguments for the contrasting viewpoints, |

have felt it necessary to go to a certain length in recalling some
main features of the development to which Einstein himself has
contributed so decisively.

As is well known, it was the intimate relation, elucidated primarily
by Boltzmann, between the laws of thermodynamics and the
statistical regularities exhibited by mechanical system with many
degrees of freedom, which guided Planck in his in genious
treatment of the problem of thermal radiation, leading him to his
fundamental discovery. While, in his work, Planck was principally
concerned with considerations of essentially statistical character
and with great caution refrained from definite conclusions as to the
extent to which the existence of the quantum implied a departure
from the foundations of mechanics and electrodynamics, Einstein's
great original contribution to quantum theory (1905) was just the
recognition of how physical phenomena like the photo-effect may
depend directly on individual quantum effects |1|. In these very
same years when, developing his theory of relativity, Einstein laid a
new foundation for physical science, he explored with a most
daring spirit the novel features of atomicity which pointed beyond
the whole framework of classical physics.

With unfailing intuition Einstein thus was led step by step to the
conclusion that any radiation process involves the emission or
absorption of individual light quanta or "photons" with energy and
momentum E=hv and P = ho (I) respectively, where his Planck's
constant, while v and o are the number of vibrations per unit time
and the number of waves per unit length, respectively.
Notwithstanding its fertility, the idea of the photon implied a quite
unforeseen dilemma, since any simple corpuscular picture of
radiation would obviously be irreconcilable with interference effects,
which present so essential an aspect of radiative phenomena, and
which can be described only in terms of a wave picture. The
acuteness of the dilemma is stressed by the fact that the
interference effects offer our only means of defining the concepts
of frequency and wavelength entering into the very expressions for
the energy and momentum of the photon.

In this situation, there could be no question of attempting a causal
analysis of radiative phenomena, but only, by a combined use of
the contrasting pictures, to estimate probabilities for the occurrence
of the individual radiation processes. However, it is most important
to realize that the recourse to probability laws under such
circumstances is essentially different in aim from the familiar
application of statistical considerations as practical means of
accounting for the properties of mechanical systems of great
structural complexity. In fact, in quantum physics we are presented
not with intricacies of this kind, but with the inability of the classical
frame of concepts to comprise the peculiar feature of indivisibility,
or "individuality," characterizing the elementary processes.

The failure of the theories of classical physics in accounting for
atomic phenomena was further accentuated by the progress of our
knowledge of the structure of atoms. Above all, Rutherford's

discovery of the atomic nucleus (I9II) revealed at once the
inadequacy of classical mechanical and electromagnetic concepts
to explain the inherent stability of the atom. Here again the
quantum theory offered a clue for the elucidation of the situation
and especially it was found possible to account for the atomic
stability, as well as for the empirical laws governing the spectra of
the elements, by assuming that any reaction of the atom resulting
in a change of its energy involved a complete transition between
two so-called stationary quantum states and that, in particular, the
spectra were emitted by a step-like process in which each transition
is accompanied by the emission of a monochromatic light quantum
of an energy just equal to that of an Einstein photon.

These ideas, which were soon confirmed by the experiments of
Franck and Hertz (1914) on the excitation of spectra by impact of
electrons on atoms, involved a further renunciation of the causal
mode of description, since evidently the interpretation of the
spectral laws implies that an atom in an excited state in general will
have the possibility of transitions with photon emission to one or
another of its lower energy states. In fact, the very idea of
stationary states is incompatible with any directive for the choice
between such transitions and leaves room only for the notion of the
relative probabilities of the individual transition processes. The only
guide in estimating such probabilities was the so-called
correspondence principle which originated in the search for the
closest possible connection between the statistical account of
atomic processes and the consequences to be expected from
classical theory, which should be valid in the limit where the actions
involved in all stages of the analysis of the phenomena are large
compared with the universal quantum.

At that time, no general self-consistent quantum theory was yet in
sight, but the prevailing attitude may perhaps be illustrated by the
following passage from a lecture by the writer from 1913

| hope that | have expressed myself sufficiently clearly so that you may
appreciate the extent to which these considerations conflict with the
admirably consistent scheme of conceptions which has been rightly
termed the classical theory of electrodynamics. On the other hand, |
have tried to convey to you the impression that - just by emphasizing so
strongly this conflict - it may also be possible in course of time to
establish a certain coherence in the new ideas.

Important progress in the development of quantum theory was
made by Einstein himself in his famous article on radiative
equilibrium in 1917 [3], where he showed that Planck's law for
thermal radiation could be simply deduced from assumptions
conforming with the basic ideas of the quantum theory of atomic
constitution. To this purpose, Einstein formulated general statistical
rules regarding the occurrence of radiative transitions between
stationary states, assuming not only that, when the atom is
exposed to a radiation field, absorption as well as emission
processes will occur with a probability per unit time proportional to
the intensity of the irradiation, but that even in the absence of
external disturbances spontaneous emission processes will take
place with a rate corresponding to a certain a priori probability.

Regarding the latter point, Einstein emphasized the fundamental
character of the statistical description in a most suggestive way by
drawing attention to the analogy between the assumptions
regarding the occurrence of the spontaneous radiative transitions
and the well-known laws governing transformations of radioactive
substances.

In connection with a thorough examination of the exigencies of
thermodynamics as regards radiation problems, Einstein stressed
the dilemma still further by pointing out that the argumentation
implied that any radiation process was “unidirected" in the sense
that not only is a momentum corresponding to a photon with the
direction of propagation transferred to an atom in the absorption
process, but that also the emitting atom will receive an equivalent
impulse in the opposite direction, although there can on the wave
picture be no question of a preference for a single direction in an
emission process. Einstein's own attitude to such startling
conclusions is expressed in a passage at the end of the article (/oc.
cit., p. 127 f.), which may be translated as follows:

These features of the elementary processes would seem to make the
development of a proper quantum treatment of radiation almost
unavoidable. The weakness of the theory lies in the fact that, on the
one hand, no closer connection with the wave concepts is obtainable
and that, on the other hand, it leaves to chance (Zufall) the time and
the direction of the elementary processes; nevertheless, | have full
confidence in the reliability of the way entered upon.

When | had the great experience of meeting Einstein for the first
time during a visit to Berlin in 1920, these fundamental questions
formed the theme of our conversations. The discussions, to which |
have often reverted in my thoughts, added to all my admiration for
Einstein a deep impression of his detached attitude. Certainly, his
favoured use of such picturesque phrases as "ghost waves
(Gespensterfelder) guiding the photons" implied no tendency to
mysticism, but illuminated rather a profound humour behind his
piercing remarks. Yet, a certain difference in attitude and outlook
remained, since, with his mastery for co-ordinating apparently
contrasting experience without abandoning continuity and causality,
Einstein was perhaps more reluctant to renounce such ideals than
someone for whom renunciation in this respect appeared to be the
only way open to proceed with the immediate task of co-ordinating
the multifarious evidence regarding atomic phenomena, which
accumulated from day to day in the exploration of this new field of
knowledge.

In the following years, during which the atomic problems attracted
the attention of rapidly increasing circles of physicists, the apparent
contradictions inherent in quantum theory were felt ever more
acutely. Illustrative of this situation is the discussion raised by the
discovery of the Stern-Gerlach effect in 1922. On the one hand, this
effect gave striking support to the idea of stationary states and in
particular to the quantum theory of the Zeeman effect developed by
Sommerfeld; on the other hand, as exposed so clearly by Einstein

29/05/00 22:42

and Ehrenfest [4], it presented with unsurmountable difficulties any
attempt at forming a picture of the behaviour of atoms ina
magnetic field. Similar paradoxes were raised by the discovery by
Compton (1924) of the change in wave-length accompanying the
scattering of X-rays by electrons. This phenomenon afforded, as is
well known, a most direct proof of the adequacy of Einstein's view
regarding the transfer of energy and momentum in radiative
processes [5]; at the same time, it was equally clear that no simple
picture of a corpuscular collision could offer an exhaustive
description of the phenomenon. Under the impact of such
difficulties, doubts were for a time entertained even regarding the
conservation of energy and momentum in the individual radiation
processes; a view, however, which very soon had to be abandoned
in face of more refined experiments bringing out the correlation
between the deflection of the photon and the corresponding
electron recoil.

The way to the clarification of the situation was, indeed, first to be
paved by the development of a more comprehensive quantum
theory. A first step towards this goal was the recognition by de
Broglie in 1925 that the wave-corpuscle duality was not confined to
the properties of radiation, but was equally unavoidable in
accounting for the behaviour of material particles. This idea, which
was soon convincingly confirmed by experiments on electron
interference phenomena, was at once greeted by Einstein, who
had already envisaged the deep-going analogy between the
properties of thermal radiation and of gases in the so-called
degenerate state [6]. The new line was pursued with the greatest
success by Schrédinger (1926) who, in particular, showed how the
stationary states of atomic systems could be represented by the
proper solutions of a wave-equation to the establishment of which
he was led by the formal analogy, originally traced by Hamilton,
between mechanical and optical problems. Still, the paradoxical
aspects of quantum theory were in no way ameliorated, but even
emphasized, by the apparent contradiction between the exigencies
of the general superposition principle of the wave description and
the feature of individuality of the elementary atomic processes.

At the same time, Heisenberg (1925) had laid the foundation of a
rational quantum mechanics, which was rapidly developed through
important contributions by Born and Jordan as well as by Dirac. In
this theory, a formalism is introduced, in which the kinematical and
dynamical variables of classical mechanics are replaced by
symbols subjected to a non-commutative algebra. Notwithstanding
the renunciation of orbital pictures, Hamilton's canonical equations
of mechanics are kept unaltered and Planck's constant enters only
in the rules of commutation pq - go = .—4*. (2) holding for any set
2

oa

of conjugate variables q and p. Through a representation of the
symbols by matrices with elements referring to transitions between
stationary states, a quantitative formulation of the correspondence
principle became for the first time possible. It may here be recalled
that an important preliminary step towards this goal was reached
through the establishment, especially by contributions of Kramers,
of a quantum theory of dispersion making basic use of Einstein's

29/05/00 22:42

general rules for the probability of the occurrence of absorption and
emission processes.

This formalism of quantum mechanics was soon proved by
Schrédinger to give results identical with those obtainable by the
mathematically often more convenient methods of wave theory,
and in the following years general methods were gradually
established for an essentially statistical description of atomic
processes combining the features of individuality and the
requirements of the superposition principle, equally characteristic of
quantum theory. Among the many advances in this period, it may
especially be mentioned that the formalism proved capable of
incorporating the exclusion principle which governs the states of
systems with several electrons, and which already before the
advent of quantum mechanics had been derived by Pauli from an
analysis of atomic spectra. The quantitative comprehension of a
vast amount of empirical evidence could leave no doubt as to the
fertility and adequacy of the quantum-mechanical formalism, but its
abstract character gave rise to a widespread feeling of uneasiness.
An elucidation of the situation should, indeed, demand a thorough
examination of the very observational problem in atomic physics.

This phase of the development was, as is well known, initiated in
1927 by Heisenberg [7], who pointed out that the knowledge
obtainable of the state of an atomic system will always involve a
peculiar "indeterminacy." Thus, any measurement of the position of
an electron by means of some device, like a microscope, making
use of high frequency radiation, will, according to the fundamental
relations (I), be connected with a momentum exchange between
the electron and the measuring agency, which is the greater the
more accurate a position measurement is attempted. In comparing
such considerations with the exigencies of the
quantum-mechanical formalism, Heisenberg called attention to the
fact that the commutation rule (2) imposes a reciprocal limitation on
the fixation of two conjugate variables, q and p, expressed by the
relation AqAp = h, (3) where Aq and Ap are suitably defined latitudes
in the determination of these variables. In pointing to the intimate
connection between the statistical description in quantum
mechanics and the actual possibilities of measurement, this
so-called indeterminacy relation is, as Heisenberg showed, most
important for the elucidation of the paradoxes involved in the
attempts of analyzing quantum effects with reference to customary
physical pictures.

The new progress in atomic physics was commented upon from
various sides at the International Physical Congress held in
September 1927, at Como in commemoration of Volta. In a lecture
on that occasion [8], | advocated a point of view conveniently
termed "complementarity," suited to embrace the characteristic
features of individuality of quantum phenomena, and at the same
time to clarify the peculiar aspects of the observational problem in
this field of experience. For this purpose, it is decisive to recognize
that, however far the phenomena transcend the scope of classical
physical explanation, the account of all evidence must be

29/05/00 22:42

--- Page 7 ---
Bohr-Einstein http://www.emr.hibu.no/lars/eng/schilpp/

expressed in classical terms. The argument is simply that by the
word "experiment" we refer to a situation where we can tell others
what we have done and what we have learned and that, therefore,
the account of the experimental arrangement and of the results of
the observations must be expressed in unambiguous language with
suitable application of the terminology of classical physics.

This crucial point, which was to become a main theme of the
discussions reported in the following, implies the impossibility of
any sharp separation between the behaviour of atomic objects and
the interaction with the measuring instruments which serve to
define the conditions under which the phenomena appear. \n fact,
the individuality of the typical quantum effects finds its proper
expression in the circumstance that any attempt of subdividing the
phenomena will demand a change in the experimental
arrangement introducing new possibilities of interaction between
objects and measuring instruments which in principle cannot be
controlled. Consequently, evidence obtained under different
experimental conditions cannot be comprehended within a single
picture, but must be regarded as complementary in the sense that
only the totality of the phenomena exhausts the possible
information about the objects.

Under these circumstances an essential element of ambiguity is
involved in ascribing conventional physical attributes to atomic
objects, as is at once evident in the dilemma regarding the
corpuscular and wave properties of electrons and photons, where
we have to do with contrasting pictures, each referring to an
essential aspect of empirical evidence. An illustrative example, of
how the apparent paradoxes are removed by an examination of the
experimental conditions under which the complementary
phenomena appear, is also given by the Compton effect, the
consistent description of which at first had presented us with such
acute difficulties. Thus, any arrangement suited to study the
exchange of energy and momentum between the electron and the
photon must involve a latitude in the spacetime description of the
interaction sufficient for the definition of wave-number and
frequency which enter into the relation (I). Conversely, any attempt
of locating the collision between the photon and the electron more
accurately would, on account of the unavoidable interaction with
the fixed scales and clocks defining the space-time reference
frame, exclude all closer account as regards the balance of
momentum and energy.

As stressed in the lecture, an adequate tool for a complementary
way of description is offered precisely by the quantum mechanical
formalism which represents a purely symbolic scheme permitting
only predictions, on lines of the correspondence principle, as to
results obtainable under conditions specified by means of classical
concepts. It must here be remembered that even in the
indeterminacy relation (3) we are dealing with an implication of the
formalism which defies unambiguous expression in words suited to
describe classical physical pictures. Thus, a sentence like "we
cannot know both the momentum and the position of an atomic

object" raises at once questions as to the physical reality of two
such attributes of the object, which can be answered only by
referring to the conditions for the unambiguous use of space-time
concepts, on the one hand, and dynamical conservation laws, on
the other hand. While the combination of these concepts into a
single picture of a causal chain of events is the essence of classical
mechanics, room for regularities beyond the grasp of such a
description is just afforded by the circumstance that the study of the
complementary phenomena demands mutually exclusive
experimental arrangements.

The necessity, in atomic physics, of a renewed examination of the
foundation for the unambiguous use of elementary physical ideas
recalls in some way the situation that led Einstein to his original
revision on the basis of all application of space-time concepts
which, by its emphasis on the primordial importance of the
observational problem, has lent such unity to our world picture.
Notwithstanding all novelty of approach, causal description is
upheld in relativity theory within any given frame of reference, but in
quantum theory the uncontrollable interaction between the objects
and the measuring instruments forces us to a renunciation even in
such respect. This recognition, however, in no way points to any
limitation of the scope of the quantum-mechanical description, and
the trend of the whole argumentation presented in the Como
lecture was to show that the viewpoint of complementarity may be
regarded as a rational generalization of the very ideal of causality.

At the general discussion in Como, we all missed the presence of
Einstein, but soon after, in October 1927, | had the opportunity to
meet him in Brussels at the Fifth Physical Conference of the Solvay
Institute, which was devoted to the theme "Electrons and Photons."
At the Solvay meetings, Einstein had from their beginning been a
most prominent figure, and several of us came to the conference
with great anticipations to learn his reaction to the latest stage of
the development which, to our view, went far in clarifying the
problems which he had himself from the outset elicited so
ingeniously. During the discussions, where the whole subject was
reviewed by contributions from many sides and where also the
arguments mentioned in the preceding pages were again
presented, Einstein expressed, however, a deep concern over the
extent to which causal account in space and time was abandoned
in quantum mechanics.

To illustrate his attitude, Einstein referred at one of the sessions

to the simple example, illustrated by Fig. |, of a particle (electron or
photon) penetrating through a hole or a narrow slit in a diaphragm
placed at some distance before a photographic plate. On account
of the diffraction of the wave

29/05/00 22:42

--- Page 9 ---
Bohr-Einstein http://www.emr.hibu.no/lars/eng/schilpp/

connected with the motion of the particle and indicated in the figure
by the thin lines, it is under such conditions not possible to predict
with certainty at what point the electron will arrive at the
photographic plate, but only to calculate the probability that, in an
experiment, the electron will be found within any given region of the
plate. The apparent difficulty, in this description, which Einstein felt
so acutely, is the fact that, if in the experiment the electron is
recorded at one point A of the plate, then it is out of the question of
ever observing an effect of this electron at another point (B),
although the laws of ordinary wave propagation offer no room for a
correlation between two such events.

Einstein's attitude gave rise to ardent discussions within a small
circle, in which Ehrenfest, who through the years had been a close
friend of us both, took part in a most active and helpful way. Surely,
we all recognized that, in the above example, the situation presents
no analogue to the application of statistics in dealing with
complicated mechanical systems, but rather recalled the
background for Einstein's own early conclusions about the
unidirection of individual radiation effects which contrasts so
strongly with a simple wave picture (cf. p. 205). The discussions,
however, centered on the question of whether the
quantum-mechanical description exhausted the possibilities of
accounting for observable phenomena or, as Einstein maintained,
the analysis could be carried further and, especially, of whether a
fuller description of the phenomena could be obtained by bringing
into consideration the detailed balance of energy and momentum in
individual processes.

To explain the trend of Einstein's arguments, it may be illustrative
here to consider some simple features of the momentum and
energy balance in connection with the location of a particle in
space and time. For this purpose, we shall examine the simple
case of a particle penetrating through a hole in a diaphragm without
or with a shutter to open and close the hole, as indicated in Figs.
2a and 2b, respectively. The equidistant parallel lines to the left in
the figures indicate the train of plane waves corresponding to the
state of motion of a particle which, before reaching the diaphragm,
has a momentum P related to the wave-number a by the second of
equations (I). In accordance with the diffraction of the waves when
passing through the hole, the state of motion of the particle to the
right of the diaphragm is represented by a spherical wave train with
a suitably defined angular aperture » and, in case of Fig. 2b, also

9 of 29 29/05/00 22:42

with a limited radial extension. Consequently, the description of this
state involves a certain latitude Ap in the momentum component of
the particle parallel to the diaphragm and, in the case of a
diaphragm with a shutter, an additional latitude AE of the kinetic
energy.

Since a measure for the latitude Aq in location of the particle in the
plane of the diaphragm is given by the radius a of the hole, and
since 3 x (I/ ca), we get, using (I), just Ap + 3 P= (h/aq), in
accordance with the indeterminacy relation (3). This result could, of
course, also be obtained directly by noticing that, due to the limited
extension of the wave-field at the place of the slit, the component
of the wave-number parallel to the plane of the diaphragm will
involve a latitude Ao # ( I/a) + (1 /Aq). Similarly, the spread of the
frequencies

aa) iy

Fic. 2a Fig, ab

of the harmonic components in the limited wave-train in Fig. 2b is
evidently A v«(I/A), where Atis the time interval during which the
shutter leaves the hole open and, thus, represents the latitude in
time of the passage of the particle through the diaphragm. From (I),
we therefore get AEF At = h, (4) again in accordance with the relation
(3) for the two conjugated variables E and t.

From the point of view of the laws of conservation, the origin of
such latitudes entering into the description of the state of the
particle after passing through the hole may be traced to the
possibilities of momentum and energy exchange with the
diaphragm or the shutter. In the reference system considered in
Figs. 2a and 2b, the velocity of the diaphragm may be disregarded
and only a change of momentum Ap between the particle and the
diaphragm needs to be taken into consideration. The shutter,
however, which leaves the hole opened during the time At, moves
with a considerable velocity v (a/At), and a momentum transfer Ap
involves therefore an energy exchange with the particle, amounting
to vAp =(I/At) Ag Ap = (h/Ad), being just of the same order of
magnitude as the latitude AE given by (4) and, thus, allowing for
momentum and energy balance.

The problem raised by Einstein was now to what extent a control of
the momentum and energy transfer, involved in a location of the
particle in space and time, can be used for a further specification of
the state of the particle after passing through the hole. Here, it must
be taken into consideration that the position and the motion of the
diaphragm and the shutter have so far been assumed to be

29/05/00 22:42

--- Page 11 ---
Bohr-Einstein

11 of 29

http://www.emr.hibu.no/lars/eng/schilpp/

accurately co-ordinated with the space-time reference frame. This
assumption implies, in the description of the state of these bodies,
an essential latitude as to their momentum and energy which need
not, of course, noticeably affect the velocities, if the diaphragm and
the shutter are sufficiently heavy. However, as soon as we want to
know the momentum and energy of these parts of the measuring
arrangement with an accuracy sufficient to control the momentum
and energy exchange with the particle under investigation, we
shall, in accordance with the general indeterminacy relations, lose
the possibility of their accurate location in space and time. We
have, therefore, to examine how far this circumstance will affect the
intended use of the whole arrangement and, as we shall see, this
crucial point clearly brings out the complementary character of the
phenomena.

Returning for a moment to the case of the simple arrangement
indicated in Fig. I, it has so far not been specified to what use it is
intended. In fact, it is only on the assumption that the diaphragm
and the plate have well-defined positions in space that it is
impossible, within the frame of the quantum-mechanical formalism,
to make more detailed predictions as to the point of the
photographic plate where the particle will be recorded. If, however,
we admit a sufficiently large latitude in the knowledge of the
position of the diaphragm it should, in principle, be possible to
control the momentum transfer to the diaphragm and, thus, to
make more detailed predictions as to the direction of the electron
path from the hole to the recording port. As regards the
quantum-mechanical description, we have to deal here with a
two-body system consisting of the diaphragm as well as of the
particle, and it is just with an explicit application of conservation
laws to such a system that we are concerned in the Compton effect
where, for instance, the observation of the recoil of the electron by
means of a cloud chamber allows us to predict in what direction the
scattered photon will eventually be observed.

The importance of considerations of this kind was, in the course of
the discussions, most interestingly illuminated by the examination

of an arrangement where between the diaphragm with the slit and
the photographic plate is inserted another

diaphragm with two parallel slits, as is shown in Fig. 3. If a parallel
beam of electrons (or photons) falls from the left on the first
diaphragm, we shall, under usual conditions, observe on the plate
an interference pattern indicated by the shading of the
photographic plate shown in front view to the right of the figure.
With intense beams, this pattern is built up by the accumulation of

29/05/00 22:42

--- Page 12 ---
Bohr-Einstein

12 of 29

http://www.emr.hibu.no/lars/eng/schilpp/

a large number of individual processes, each giving rise to a small
spot on the photographic plate, and the distribution of these spots
follows a simple law derivable from the wave analysis. The same
distribution should also be found in the statistical account of many
experiments performed with beams so faint that in a single
exposure only one electron (or photon) will arrive at the
photographic plate at some spot shown in the figure as a small
star. Since, now, as indicated by the broken arrows, the momentum
transferred to the first diaphragm ought to be different if the
electron was assumed to pass through the upper or the lower slit in
the second diaphragm, Einstein suggested that a control of the
momentum transfer would permit a closer analysis of the
phenomenon and, in particular, to decide through which of the two
slits the electron had passed before arriving at the plate.

A closer examination showed, however, that the suggested control
of the momentum transfer would involve a latitude in the knowledge
of the position of the diaphragm which would exclude the
appearance of the interference phenomena in question. In fact, if
is the small angle between the conjectured paths of a particle
passing through the upper or the lower slit, the difference of
momentum transfer in these two cases will, according to (I), be
equal to how and any control of the momentum of the diaphragm
with an accuracy sufficient to measure this difference will, due to
the indeterminacy relation, involve a minimum latitude of the
position of the diaphragm, comparable with I/ow. If, as in the figure,
the diaphragm with the two slits is placed in the middle between the
first diaphragm and the photographic plate, it will be seen that the
number of fringes per unit length will be just equal to ow and, since
an uncertainty in the position of the first diaphragm of the amount
of I/ow will cause an equal uncertainty in the positions of the
fringes, it follows that no interference effect can appear. The same
result is easily shown to hold for any other placing of the second
diaphragm between the first diaphragm and the plate, and would
also be obtained if, instead of the first diaphragm, another of these
three bodies were used for the control, for the purpose suggested,
of the momentum transfer.

This point is of great logical consequence, since it is only the
circumstance that we are presented with a choice of either tracing
the path of a particle or observing interference effects, which allows
us to escape from the paradoxical necessity of concluding that the
behaviour of an electron or a photon should depend on the
presence of a slit in the diaphragm through which it could be
proved not to pass. We have here to do with a typical example of
how the complementary phenomena appear under mutually
exclusive experimental arrangements (cf. p. 2IO) and are just faced
with the impossibility, in the analysis of quantum effects, of drawing
any sharp separation between an independent behaviour of atomic
objects and their interaction with the measuring instruments which
serve to define the conditions under which the phenomena occur.

Our talks about the attitude to be taken in face of a novel situation
as regards analysis and synthesis of experience touched naturally

on many aspects of philosophical thinking, but, in spite of all
divergencies of approach and opinion, a most humorous spirit
animated the discussions. On his side, Einstein mockingly asked
us whether we could really believe that the providential authorities
took recourse to dice-playing (". . . ob der liebe Gott wurfelt'), to
which | replied by pointing at the great caution, already called for by
ancient thinkers, in ascribing attributes to Providence in every-day
language. | remember also how at the peak of the discussion
Ehrenfest, in his affectionate manner of teasing his friends, jokingly
hinted at the apparent similarity between Einstein's attitude and
that of the opponents of relativity theory; but instantly Ehrenfest
added that he would not be able to find relief in his own mind
before concord with Einstein was reached.

Einstein's concern and criticism provided a most valuable incentive
for us all to reexamine the various aspects of the situation as
regards the description of atomic phenomena. To me it was a
welcome stimulus to clarify still further the role played by the
measuring instruments and, in order to bring into strong relief the
mutually exclusive character of the experimental conditions under
which the complementary phenomena appear, | tried in those days
to sketch various apparatus in a pseudo-realistic style of which the
following figures are examples. Thus, for the study of an
interference phenomenon of the type indicated in Fig. 3, it suggests
itself to use an experimental arrangement like that shown in Fig. 4,
where the solid parts of the apparatus, serving as diaphragms and
plate-holder, are

Fig. 4

firmly bolted to a common support. In such an arrangement, where
the knowledge of the relative positions of the diaphragms and the
photographic plate is secured by a rigid connection, it is obviously
impossible to control the momentum exchanged between the
particle and the separate parts of the apparatus. The only way in
which, in such an arrangement, we could insure that the particle
passed through one of the slits in the second diaphragm is to cover
the other slit by a lid, as indicated in the figure; but if the slit is
covered, there is of course no question of any interference
phenomenon, and on the plate we shall simply observe a
continuous distribution as in the case of the single fixed diaphragm

in Fig. I.

In the study of phenomena in the account of which we are dealing
with detailed momentum balance, certain parts of the whole device
must naturally be given the freedom to move independently of
others. Such an apparatus is sketched in Fig. 5, where a
diaphragm with a slit is suspended by weak springs from a solid
yoke bolted to the support on which also other immobile parts of
the arrangement are to be fastened. The scale on the diaphragm
together with the pointer on the bearings of the yoke refer to such
study of the motion of the diaphragm, as may be required for an
estimate of the momentum transferred to it, permitting one to draw
conclusions as to the deflection suffered by the particle in passing
through the slit. Since, however, any reading of the scale, in
whatever way performed, will

Fig. 5

involve an uncontrollable change in the momentum of the
diaphragm, there will always be, in conformity with the
indeterminacy principle, a reciprocal relationship between our
knowledge of the position of the slit and the accuracy of the
momentum control.

In the same semi-serious style, Fig. 6 represents a part of an
arrangement suited for the study of phenomena which, in contrast
to those just discussed, involve time co-ordination explicitly. It
consists of a shutter rigidly connected with a robust clock resting on
the support which carries a diaphragm and on which further parts
of similar character, regulated by the same clock-work or by other
clocks standardized relatively to it, are also to be fixed. The special
aim of the figure is to underline that a clock is a piece of machinery,
the working of which can completely be accounted for by ordinary
mechanics and will be affected neither by reading of the position of
its hands nor by the interaction between its accessories and an
atomic particle. In securing the opening of the hole at a definite
moment, an apparatus of this type might, for instance, be used for
an accurate measurement of the time an electron or a photon takes
to come from the diaphragm to some other place, but evidently, it
would leave no possibility of controlling the energy transfer to

29/05/00 22:42

--- Page 15 ---
Bohr-Einstein http://www.emr.hibu.no/lars/eng/schilpp/

Fig. 6

the shutter with the aim of drawing conclusions as to the energy of
the particle which has passed through the diaphragm. If we are
interested in such conclusions we must, of course, use an
arrangement where the shutter devices can no longer serve as
accurate clocks, but where the knowledge of the moment when the
hole in the diaphragm is open involves a latitude connected with
the accuracy of the energy measurement by the general relation

(4).

The contemplation of such more or less practical arrangements
and their more or less fictitious use proved most instructive in
directing attention to essential features of the problems. The main
point here is the distinction between the objects under investigation
and the measuring instruments which serve to define, in classical
terms, the conditions under which the phenomena appear.
Incidentally, we may remark that, for the illustration of the
preceding considerations, it is not relevant that experiments
involving an accurate control of the momentum or energy transfer
from atomic particles to heavy bodies like diaphragms and shutters
would be very difficult to perform, if practicable at all. It is only
decisive that, in contrast to the proper measuring instruments,
these bodies together with the particles would in such a case
constitute the system to which the quantum-mechanical formalism
has to be applied. As regards the specification of the conditions for
any well-defined application of the formalism, it is moreover
essential that the whole experimental arrangement be taken into
account. In fact, the introduction of any further piece of apparatus,
like a mirror, in the way of a particle might imply new interference
effects essentially influencing the predictions as regards the results
to be eventually recorded.

The extent to which renunciation of the visualization of atomic
phenomena is imposed upon us by the impossibility of their
subdivision is strikingly illustrated by the following example to which
Einstein very early called attention and often has reverted. If a
semi-reflecting mirror is placed in the way of a photon, leaving two
possibilities for its direction of propagation, the photon may either

be recorded on one, and only one, of two photographic plates
situated at great distances in the two directions in question, or else
we may, by replacing the plates by mirrors, observe effects
exhibiting an interference between the two reflected wave-trains. In
any attempt of a pictorial representation of the behaviour of the
photon we would, thus, meet with the difficulty: to be obliged to say,
on the one hand, that the photon always chooses one of the two
ways and, on the other hand, that it behaves as if it had passed
both ways.

It is just arguments of this kind which recall the impossibility of
subdividing quantum phenomena and reveal the ambiguity in
ascribing customary physical attributes to atomic objects. In
particular, it must be realized that--besides in the account of the
placing and timing of the instruments forming the experimental
arrangement--all unambiguous use of space-time concepts in the
description of atomic phenomena is confined to the recording of
observations which refer to marks on a photographic plate or to
similar practically irreversible amplification effects like the building
of a water drop around an ion in a cloud-chamber. Although, of
course, the existence of the quantum of action is ultimately
responsible for the properties of the materials of which the
measuring instruments are built and on which the functioning of the
recording devices depends, this circumstance is not relevant for the
problems of the adequacy and completeness of the
quantum-mechanical description in its aspects here discussed.

These problems were instructively commented upon from different
sides at the Solvay meeting , in the same session where
Einstein raised his general objections. On that occasion an
interesting discussion arose also about how to speak of the
appearance of phenomena for which only predictions of statistical
character can be made. The question was whether, as to the
occurrence of individual effects, we should adopt a terminology
proposed by Dirac, that we were concerned with a choice on the
part of "nature" or, as suggested by Heisenberg, we should say that
we have to do with a choice on the part of the "observer"
constructing the measuring instruments and reading their
recording. Any such terminology would, however, appear dubious
since, on the one hand, it is hardly reasonable to endow nature
with volition in the ordinary sense, while, on the other hand, it is
certainly not possible for the observer to influence the events which
may appear under the conditions he has arranged. To my mind,
there is no other alternative than to admit that, in this field of
experience, we are dealing with individual phenomena and that our
possibilities of handling the measuring instruments allow us only to
make a choice between the different complementary types of
phenomena we want to study.

The epistemological problems touched upon here were more
explicitly dealt with in my contribution to the issue of
Naturwissenschatten in celebration of Planck's 70th birthday in
1929. In this article, a comparison was also made between the
lesson derived from the discovery of the universal quantum of

action and the development which has followed the discovery of
the finite velocity of light and which, through Einstein's pioneer
work, has so greatly clarified basic principles of natural philosophy.
In relativity theory, the emphasis on the dependence of all
phenomena on the reference frame opened quite new ways of
tracing general physical laws of unparalleled scope. In quantum
theory, it was argued, the logical comprehension of hitherto
unsuspected fundamental regularities governing atomic
phenomena has demanded the recognition that no sharp
separation can be made between an independent behaviour of the
objects and their interaction with the measuring instruments which
define the reference frame.

In this respect, quantum theory presents us with a novel situation in
physical science, but attention was called to the very close analogy
with the situation as regards analysis and synthesis of experience,
which we meet in many other fields of human knowledge and
interest. As is well known, many of the difficulties in psychology
originate in the different placing of the separation lines between
object and subject in the analysis of various aspects of psychical
experience. Actually, words like "thoughts" and "sentiments,"
equally indispensable to illustrate the variety and scope of
conscious life, are used in a similar complementary way as are
space-time co-ordination and dynamical conservation laws in
atomic physics. A precise formulation of such analogies involves, of
course, intricacies of terminology, and the writer's position is
perhaps best indicated in a passage in the article, hinting at the
mutually exclusive relationship which will always exist between the
practical use of any word and attempts at its strict definition. The
principal aim, however, of these considerations, which were not
least inspired by the hope of influencing Einstein's attitude, was to
point to perspectives of bringing general epistemological problems
into relief by means of a lesson derived from the study of new, but
fundamentally simple physical experience.

At the next meeting with Einstein at the Solvay Conference in 1930,
our discussions took quite a dramatic turn. As an objection to the
view that a control of the interchange of momentum and energy
between the objects and the measuring instruments was excluded
if these instruments should serve their purpose of defining the
space-time frame of the phenomena, Einstein brought forward the
argument that such control should be possible when the exigencies
of relativity theory were taken into consideration. In particular, the
general relationship between energy and mass, expressed in
Einstein's famous formula E = mc*2 (5) should allow, by means of
simple weighing, to measure the total energy of any system and,
thus, in principle to control the energy transferred to it when it
interacts with an atomic object.

As an arrangement suited for such purpose, Einstein proposed the
device indicated in Fig. 7, consisting of a box with

29/05/00 22:42

--- Page 18 ---
Bohr-Einstein http://www.emr.hibu.no/lars/eng/schilpp/

Fig. 7

a hole in its side, which could be opened or closed by a shutter
moved by means of a clock-work within the box. If, in the
beginning, the box contained a certain amount of radiation and the
clock was set to open the shutter for a very short interval at a
chosen time, it could be achieved that a single photon was
released through the hole at a moment known with as great
accuracy as desired. Moreover, it would apparently also be
possible, by weighing the whole box before and after this event, to
measure the energy of the photon with any accuracy wanted, in
definite contradiction to the reciprocal indeterminacy of time and
energy quantities in quantum mechanics.

This argument amounted to a serious challenge and gave rise toa
thorough examination of the whole problem. At the outcome of the
discussion, to which Einstein himself contributed effectively, it
became clear, however, that this argument could not be upheld. In
fact, in the consideration of the problem, it was found necessary to
look closer into the consequences of the identification of inertial
and gravitational mass implied in the application of relation (5).
Especially, it was essential to take into account the relationship
between the rate of a clock and its position in a gravitational
field--well known from the red-shift of the lines in the sun's
spectrum--following from Einstein's principle of equivalence
between gravity effects and the phenomena observed in
accelerated reference frames.

Our discussion concentrated on the possible application of an
apparatus incorporating Einstein's device and drawn in Fig. 8 in the
same pseudo-realistic style as some of the preceding figures. The
box, of which a section is shown in order to exhibit its interior, is
suspended in a spring-balance and is furnished with a pointer to
read its position on a scale fixed to the balance support. The
weighing of the box may thus be performed with any given
accuracy Am by adjusting the balance to its zero position by means
of suitable loads. The essential point is now that any determination
of this position with a given accuracy Aq will involve a minimum
latitude Ap in the control of the momentum of the box connected
with Aq by the relation (3). This latitude must obviously again be
smaller than the total impulse which, during the whole interval T of
the balancing procedure, can be given by the gravitational field to a
body with a mass Am, or

aps” Tgam(6)
Ay

where g is the gravity constant. The greater the accuracy of the
reading q of the pointer, the longer must, consequently, be the
balancing interval T, if a given accuracy Am of the weighing of the
box with its content shall be obtained.

Now, according to general relativity theory, a clock, when displaced
in the direction of the gravitational force by an amount of aq, will
change its rate in such a way that its reading

Fig. 8

in the course of a time interval T will differ by an amount AT given
by the relation A? = + g Aq (7) By comparing (6) and (7) we see,
T c

therefore, that after the weighing procedure there will in our
knowledge of the adjustment of the clock be a latitude AT > tl.

c* Am
Together with the formula (5), this relation again leads to AT AE >
h, in accordance with the indeterminacy principle. Consequently, a
use of the apparatus as a means of accurately measuring the
energy of the photon will prevent us from controlling the moment of
its escape.

The discussion, so illustrative of the power and consistency of
relativistic arguments, thus emphasized once more the necessity of
distinguishing, in the study of atomic phenomena, between the
proper measuring instruments which serve to define the reference
frame and those parts which are to be regarded as objects under
investigation and in the account of which quantum effects cannot
be disregarded. Notwithstanding the most suggestive confirmation
of the soundness and wide scope of the quantum-mechanical way

19 of 29 29/05/00 22:42

Bohr-Einstein http://www.emr.hibu.no/lars/eng/schilpp/

of description, Einstein nevertheless, in a following conversation
with me, expressed a feeling of disquietude as regards the
apparent lack of firmly laid down principles for the explanation of
nature, in which all could agree. From my viewpoint, however, |
could only answer that, in dealing with the task of bringing order
into an entirely new field of experience, we could hardly trust in any
accustomed principles, however broad, apart from the demand of
avoiding logical inconsistencies and, in this respect, the
mathematical formalism of quantum mechanics should surely meet
all requirements.

The Solvay meeting in 1930 was the last occasion where, in
common discussions with Einstein, we could benefit from the
stimulating and mediating influence of Ehrenfest, but shortly before
his deeply deplored death in 1933 he told me that Einstein was far
from satisfied and with his usual acuteness had discerned new
aspects of the situation which strengthened his critical attitude. In
fact, by further examining the possibilities for the application of a
balance arrangement, Einstein had perceived alternative
procedures which, even if they did not allow the use he originally
intended, might seem to enhance the paradoxes beyond the
possibilities of logical solution. Thus, Einstein had pointed out that,
after a preliminary weighing of the box with the clock and the
subsequent escape of the photon, one was still left with the choice
of either repeating the weighing or opening the box and comparing
the reading of the clock with the standard time scale.
Consequently, we are at this stage still free to choose whether we
want to draw conclusions either about the energy of the photon or
about the moment when it left the box. Without in any way
interfering with the photon between its escape and its later
interaction with other suitable measuring instruments, we are, thus,
able to make accurate predictions pertaining either to the moment
of its arrival or to the amount of energy liberated by its absorption.
Since, however, according to the quantum-mechanical formalism,
the specification of the state of an isolated particle cannot involve
both a well-defined connection with the time scale and an accurate
fixation of the energy, it might thus appear as if this formalism did
not offer the means of an adequate description.

Once more Einstein's searching spirit had elicited a peculiar aspect
of the situation in quantum theory, which in a most striking manner
illustrated how far we have here transcended customary
explanation of natural phenomena. Still, | could not agree with the
trend of his remarks as reported by Ehrenfest. In my opinion, there
could be no other way to deem a logically consistent mathematical
formalism as inadequate than by demonstrating the departure of its
consequences from experience or by proving that its predictions did
not exhaust the possibilities of observation, and Einstein's
argumentation could be directed to neither of these ends. In fact,
we must realize that in the problem in question we are not dealing
with a single specified experimental arrangement, but are referring
to two different, mutually exclusive arrangements. In the one, the
balance together with another piece of apparatus like a
spectrometer is used for the study of the energy transfer by a

20 of 29 29/05/00 22:42

Bohr-Einstein

21 of 29

http://www.emr.hibu.no/lars/eng/schilpp/

photon; in the other, a shutter regulated by a standardized clock
together with another apparatus of similar kind, accurately timed
relatively to the clock, is used for the study of the time of
propagation of a photon over a given distance. In both these cases,
as also assumed by Einstein, the observable effects are expected
to be in complete conformity with the predictions of the theory.

The problem again emphasizes the necessity of considering the
whole experimental arrangement, the specification of which is
imperative for any well-defined application of the
quantum-mechanical formalism. Incidentally, it may be added that
paradoxes of the kind contemplated by Einstein are encountered
also in such simple arrangements as sketched in Fig. 5. In fact,
after a preliminary measurement of the momentum of the
diaphragm, we are in principle offered the choice, when an electron
or photon has passed through the slit, either to repeat the
momentum measurement or to control the position of the
diaphragm and, thus, to make predictions pertaining to alternative
subsequent observations. It may also be added that it obviously
can make no difference as regards observable effects obtainable
by a definite experimental arrangement, whether our plans of
constructing or handling the instruments are fixed beforehand or
whether we prefer to postpone the completion of our planning until
a later moment when the particle is already on its way from one
instrument to another.

In the quantum-mechanical description our freedom of constructing
and handling the experimental arrangement finds its proper
expression in the possibility of choosing the classically defined
parameters entering in any proper application of the formalism.
Indeed, in all such respects quantum mechanics exhibits a
correspondence with the state of affairs familiar from classical
physics, which is as close as possible when considering the
individuality inherent in the quantum phenomena. Just in helping to
bring out this point so clearly, Einstein's concern had therefore
again been a most welcome incitement to explore the essential
aspects of the situation.

The next Solvay meeting in 1933 was devoted to the problems of
the structure and properties of atomic nuclei, in which field such
great advances were made just in that period due to the
experimental discoveries as well as to new fruitful applications of
quantum mechanics. It need in this connection hardly be recalled
that just the evidence obtained by the study of artificial nuclear
transformations gave a most direct test of Einstein's fundamental
law regarding the equivalence of mass and energy, which was to
prove an evermore important guide for researches in nuclear
physics. It may also be mentioned how Einstein's intuitive
recognition of the intimate relationship between the law of
radioactive transformations and the probability rules governing
individual radiation effects (cf. p. 205) was confirmed by the
quantum-mechanical explanation of spontaneous nuclear
disintegrations. In fact, we are here dealing with a typical example

29/05/00 22:42

--- Page 22 ---
Bohr-Einstein

22 of 29

http://www.emr.hibu.no/lars/eng/schilpp/

of the statistical mode of description, and the complementary
relationship between energy-momentum conservation and
time-space co-ordination is most strikingly exhibited in the
well-known paradox of particle penetration through potential
barriers.

Einstein himself did not attend this meeting, which took place at a
time darkened by the tragic developments in the political world
which were to influence his fate so deeply and add so greatly to his
burdens in the service of humanity. A few months earlier, on a visit
to Princeton where Einstein was then guest of the newly founded
Institute for Advanced Study to which he soon after became
permanently attached, | had, however, opportunity to talk with him
again about the epistemological aspects of atomic physics, but the
difference between our ways of approach and expression still
presented obstacles to mutual understanding. While, so far,
relatively few persons had taken part in the discussions reported in
this article, Einstein's critical attitude towards the views on quantum
theory adhered to by many physicists was soon after brought to
public attention through a paper with the title "Can
Quantum-Mechanical Description of Physical Reality Be
Considered Complete?," published in 1935 by Einstein, Podolsky
and Rosen.

The argumentation in this paper is based on a criterion which the
authors express in the following sentence: "If, without in any way
disturbing a system, we can predict with certainty (i.e., with
probability equal to unity) the value of a physical quantity, then
there exists an element of physical reality corresponding to this
physical quantity." By an elegant exposition of the consequences of
the quantum-mechanical formalism as regards the representation
of a state of a system, consisting of two parts which have been in
interaction for a limited time interval, it is next shown that different
quantities, the fixation of which cannot be combined in the
representation of one of the partial systems, can nevertheless be
predicted by measurements pertaining to the other partial system.
According to their criterion, the authors therefore conclude that
quantum mechanics does not "provide a complete description of
the physical reality," and they express their belief that it should be
possible to develop a more adequate account of the phenomena.

Due to the lucidity and apparently incontestable character of the
argument, the paper of Einstein, Podolsky and Rosen created a stir
among physicists and has played a large role in general
philosophical discussion. Certainly the issue is of a very subtle
character and suited to emphasize how far, in quantum theory, we
are beyond the reach of pictorial visualization. It will be seen,
however, that we are here dealing with problems of just the same
kind as those raised by Einstein in previous discussions, and, in an
article which appeared a few months later , | tried to show that
from the point of view of complementarity the apparent
inconsistencies were completely removed. The trend of the
argumentation was in substance the same as that exposed in the
foregoing pages, but the aim of recalling the way in which the

29/05/00 22:42

--- Page 23 ---
Bohr-Einstein

23 of 29

http://www.emr.hibu.no/lars/eng/schilpp/

situation was discussed at that time may be an apology for citing
certain passages from my article.

Thus, after referring to the conclusions derived by Einstein,
Podolsky and Rosen on the basis of their criterion, | wrote:

Such an argumentation, however, would hardly seem suited to affect
the soundness of quantum-mechanical description, which is based on
a coherent mathematical formalism covering automatically any
procedure of measurement like that indicated. The apparent
contradiction in fact discloses only an essential inadequacy of the
customary viewpoint of natural philosophy for a rational account of
physical phenomena of the type with which we are concerned in
quantum mechanics. Indeed the finite interaction between object and
measuring agencies conditioned by the very existence of the quantum
of action entails - because of the impossibility of controlling the reaction
of the object on the measuring instruments, if these are to serve their
purpose - the necessity of a final renunciation of the classical ideal of
causality and a radical revision of our attitude towards the problem of
physical reality. In fact, as we shall see, a criterion of reality like that
proposed by the named authors contains - however cautious its
formulation may appear - an essential ambiguity when it is applied to
the actual problems with which we are here concerned.

As regards the special problem treated by Einstein, Podolsky and
Rosen, it was next shown that the consequences of the formalism
as regards the representation of the state of a system consisting of
two interacting atomic objects correspond to the simple arguments
mentioned in the preceding in connection with the discussion of the
experimental arrangements suited for the study of complementary
phenomena. In fact, although any pair gq and p, of conjugate space
and momentum variables obeys the rule of non-commutative
multiplication expressed by (2), and can thus only be fixed with
reciprocal latitudes given by (3), the difference qi- qz between two
space-co-ordinates referring to the constituents of the system will
commute with the sum pi + p2 of the corresponding momentum
components, as follows directly from the commutability of ql with p2
and q2 with pl. Both ql--g2 and pl + p2 can, therefore, be accurately
fixed in a state of the complex system and, consequently, we can
predict the values of either q1 or pl if either g2 or p2, respectively,
are determined by direct measurements. If, for the two parts of the
system, we take a particle and a diaphragm, like that sketched in
Fig. 5, we see that the possibilities of specifying the state of the
particle by measurements on the diaphragm just correspond to the
situation described on p. 220 and further discussed on p. 230,
where it was mentioned that, after the particle has passed through
the diaphragm, we have in principle the choice of measuring either
the position of the diaphragm or its momentum and, in each case,
to make predictions as to subsequent observations pertaining to
the particle. As repeatedly stressed, the principal point is here that
such measurements demand mutually exclusive experimental
arrangements.

The argumentation of the article was summarized in the following
passage:

From our point of view we now see that the wording of the
abovementioned criterion of physical reality proposed by Einstein,

29/05/00 22:42

Bohr-Einstein

24 of 29

http://www.emr.hibu.no/lars/eng/schilpp/

Podolsky, and Rosen contains an ambiguity as regards the meaning of
the expression without in any way disturbing a system.’ Of course there
is in a case like that just considered no question of a mechanical
disturbance of the system under investigation during the last critical
stage of the measuring procedure. But even at this stage there is
essentially the question of an influence on the very conditions which
define the possible types of predictions regarding the future behaviour
of the system. Since these conditions constitute an inherent element of
the description of any phenomenon to which the term "physical reality"
can be properly attached, we see that the argumentation of the
mentioned authors does not justify their conclusion that
quantum-mechanical description is essentially incomplete. On the
contrary, this description, as appears from the preceding discussion,
may be characterized as a rational utilization of all possibilities of
unambiguous interpretation of measurements, compatible with the
finite and uncontrollable interaction between the objects and the
measuring instruments in the field of quantum theory. In fact, it is only
the mutual exclusion of any two experimental procedures, permitting
the unambiguous definition of complementary physical quantities,
which provides room for new physical laws, the coexistence of which
might at first sight appear irreconcilable with the basic principles of
science. It is just this entirely new situation as regards the description
of physical phenomena that the notion of complementarity aims at
characterizing.

Rereading these passages, | am deeply aware of the inefficiency of
expression which must have made it very difficult to appreciate the
trend of the argumentation aiming to bring out the essential
ambiguity involved in a reference to physical attributes of objects
when dealing with phenomena where no sharp distinction can be
made between the behaviour of the objects themselves and their
interaction with the measuring instruments. | hope, however, that
the present account of the discussions with Einstein in the
foregoing years, which contributed so greatly to make us familiar
with the situation in quantum physics, may give a clearer
impression of the necessity of a radical revision of basic principles
for physical explanation in order to restore logical order in this field
of experience.

Einstein's own views at that time are presented in an article
"Physics and Reality," published in 1936 in the Journal of the
Franklin Institute . Starting from a most illuminating exposition
of the gradual development of the fundamental principles in the
theories of classical physics and their relation to the problem of
physical reality, Einstein here argues that the quantum-mechanical
description is to be considered merely as a means of accounting
for the average behaviour of a large number of atomic systems and
his attitude to the belief that it should offer an exhaustive
description of the individual phenomena is expressed in the
following words: "To believe this is logically possible without
contradiction; but it is so very contrary to my scientific instinct that |
cannot forego the search for a more complete conception."

Even if such an attitude might seem well-balanced in itself, it
nevertheless implies a rejection of the whole argumentation
exposed in the preceding, aiming to show that, in quantum
mechanics, we are not dealing with an arbitrary renunciation of a

that such an analysis is in principle excluded. The peculiar

individuality of the quantum effects presents us, as regards the
comprehension of well-defined evidence, with a novel situation
unforeseen in classical physics and irreconcilable with conventional
ideas suited for our orientation and adjustment to ordinary
experience. It is in this respect that quantum theory has called for a
renewed revision of the foundation for the unambiguous use of
elementary concepts, as a further step in the development which,
since the advent of relativity theory, has been so characteristic of
modern science.

In the following years, the more philosophical aspects of the
situation in atomic physics aroused the interest of ever larger
circles and were, in particular, discussed at the Second
International Congress for the Unity of Science in Copenhagen in
July 1936. In a lecture on this occasion , | tried especially to
stress the analogy in epistemological respects between the
limitation imposed on the causal description in atomic physics and
situations met with in other fields of knowledge. A principal purpose
of such parallels was to call attention to the necessity in many
domains of general human interest to face problems of a similar
kind as those which had arisen in quantum theory and thereby to
give a more familiar background for the apparently extravagant way
of expression which physicists have developed to cope with their
acute difficulties.

Besides the complementary features conspicuous in psychology
and already touched upon (cf. p. 224), examples of such
relationships can also be traced in biology, especially as regards
the comparison between mechanistic and vitalistic viewpoints. Just
with respect to the observational problem, this last question had
previously been the subject of an address to the International
Congress on Light Therapy held in Copenhagen in 1932 , where
it was incidentally pointed out that even the psycho-physical
parallelism as envisaged by Leibniz and Spinoza has obtained a
wider scope through the development of atomic physics, which
forces us to an attitude towards the problem of explanation
recalling ancient wisdom, that when searching for harmony in life
one must never forget that in the drama of existence we are
ourselves both actors and spectators.

Utterances of this kind would naturally in many minds evoke the’
impression of an underlying mysticism foreign to the spirit of
science; at the above mentioned Congress in 1936 | therefore tried
to clear up such misunderstandings and to explain that the only
question was an endeavour to clarify the conditions, in each field of
knowledge, for the analysis and synthesis of experience . Yet, |
am afraid that | had in this respect only little success in convincing
my listeners, for whom the dissent among the physicists
themselves was naturally a cause of scepticism as to the necessity
of going so far in renouncing customary demands as regards the
explanation of natural phenomena. Not least through a new
discussion with Einstein in Princeton in 1937, where we did not get
beyond a humourous contest concerning which side Spinoza would

have taken if he had lived to see the development of our days, |
was strongly reminded of the importance of utmost caution in all
questions of terminology and dialectics.

These aspects of the situation were especially discussed at a
meeting in Warsaw in 1938, arranged by the International Institute
of Intellectual Co-operation of the League of Nations . The
preceding years had seen great progress in quantum physics due
to a number of fundamental discoveries regarding the constitution
and properties of atomic nuclei as well as due to important
developments of the mathematical formalism taking the
requirements of relativity theory into account. In the last respect,
Dirac's ingenious quantum theory of the electron offered a most
striking illustration of the power and fertility of the general
quantum-mechanical way of description. In the phenomena of
creation and annihilation of electron pairs we have in fact to do with
new fundamental features of atomicity, which are intimately
connected with the non-classical aspects of quantum statistics
expressed in the exclusion principle, and which have demanded a
still more far-reaching renunciation of explanation in terms of a
pictorial representation.

Meanwhile, the discussion of the epistemological problems in
atomic physics attracted as much attention as ever and, in
commenting on Einstein's views as regards the incompleteness of
the quantum-mechanical mode of description, | entered more
directly on questions of terminology. In this connection | warned
especially against phrases, often found in the physical literature,
such as "disturbing of phenomena by observation" or "creating
physical attributes to atomic objects by measurements." Such
phrases, which may serve to remind of the apparent paradoxes in
quantum theory, are at the same time apt to cause confusion, since
words like "phenomena" and "observations," just as "attributes" and
"measurements," are used in a way hardly compatible with
common language and practical definition.

As amore appropriate way of expression | advocated the
application of the word phenomenon exclusively to refer to the
observations obtained under specified circumstances, including an
account of the whole experimental arrangement. In such
terminology, the observational problem is free of any special
intricacy since, in actual experiments, all observations are
expressed by unambiguous statements referring, for instance, to
the registration of the point at which an electron arrives at a
photographic plate. Moreover, speaking in such a way is just suited
to emphasize that the appropriate physical interpretation of the
symbolic quantum-mechanical formalism amounts only to
predictions, of determinate or statistical character, pertaining to
individual phenomena appearing under conditions defined by
classical physical concepts.

Notwithstanding all differences between the physical problems
which have given rise to the development of relativity theory and
quantum theory, respectively, a comparison of purely logical

aspects of relativistic and complementary argumentation reveals
striking similarities as regards the renunciation of the absolute
significance of conventional physical attributes of objects. Also, the
neglect of the atomic constitution of the measuring instruments
themselves, in the account of actual experience, is equally
characteristic of the applications of relativity and quantum theory.
Thus, the smallness of the quantum of action compared with the
actions involved in usual experience, including the arranging and
handling of physical apparatus, is as essential in atomic physics as
is the enormous number of atoms composing the world in the
general theory of relativity which, as often pointed out, demands
that dimensions of apparatus for measuring angles can be made
small compared with the radius of curvature of space.

In the Warsaw lecture, | commented upon the use of not directly
visualizable symbolism in relativity and quantum theory in the
following way:

Even the formalisms, which in both theories within their scope offer
adequate means of comprehending all conceivable experience, exhibit
deepgoing analogies. In fact, the astounding simplicity of the
generalization of classical physical theories, which are obtained by the
use of multidimensional geometry and non-commutative algebra,
respectively, rests in both cases essentially on the introduction of the
conventional symbol J=1. The abstract character of the formalisms
concerned is indeed, on closer examination, as typical of relativity
theory as it is of quantum mechanics, and it is in this respect purely a
matter of tradition if the former theory is considered as a completion of
classical physics rather than as a first fundamental step in the
thoroughgoing revision of our conceptual means of comparing
observations, which the modern development of physics has forced
upon us.

It is, of course, true that in atomic physics we are confronted with a
number of unsolved fundamental problems, especially as regards
the intimate relationship between the elementary unit of electric
charge and the universal quantum of action; but these problems
are no more connected with the epistemological points here
discussed than is the adequacy of relativistic argumentation with
the issue of thus far unsolved problems of cosmology. Both in
relativity and in quantum theory we are concerned with new
aspects of scientific analysis and synthesis and, in this connection,
it is interesting to note that, even in the great epoch of critical
philosophy in the former century, there was only question to what
extent a priori arguments could be given for the adequacy of
space-time co-ordination and causal connection of experience, but
never question of rational generalizations or inherent limitations of
such categories of human thinking.

Although in more recent years | have had several occasions of
meeting Einstein, the continued discussions, from which | always
have received new impulses, have so far not led to a common view
about the epistemological problems in atomic physics, and our
opposing views are perhaps most clearly stated in a recent issue of
Dialectica , bringing a general discussion of these problems.
Realizing, however, the many obstacles for mutual understanding
as regards a matter where approach and background must

influence everyone's attitude, | have welcomed this opportunity of a
broader exposition of the development by which, to my mind, a
veritable crisis in physical science has been overcome. The lesson
we have hereby received would seem to have brought us a
decisive step further in the never-ending struggle for harmony
between content and form, and taught us once again that no
content can be grasped without a formal frame and that any form,
however useful it has hitherto proved, may be found to be too
narrow to comprehend new experience.

Surely, in a situation like this, where it has been difficult to reach
mutual understanding not only between philosophers and
physicists but even between physicists of different schools, the
difficulties have their root not seldom in the preference for a certain
use of language suggesting itself from the different lines of
approach. In the Institute in Copenhagen, where through those
years a number of young physicists from various countries came
together for discussions, we used, when in trouble, often to comfort
ourselves with jokes, among them the old saying of the two kinds of
truth. To the one kind belong statements so simple and clear that
the opposite assertion obvious]y could not be defended. The other
kind, the so-called "deep truths," are statements in which the
opposite also contains deep truth. Now, the development in a new
field will usually pass through stages in which chaos becomes
gradually replaced by order; but it is not least in the intermediate
stage where deep truth prevails that the work is really exciting and
inspires the imagination to search for a firmer hold. For such
endeavours of seeking the proper balance between seriousness
and humour, Einstein's own personality stands as a great example
and, when expressing my belief that through a singularly fruitful
co-operation of a whole generation of physicists we are nearing the
goal where logical order to a large extent allows us to avoid deep
truth, | hope that it will be taken in his spirit and may serve as an
apology for several utterances in the preceding pages.

The discussions with Einstein which have formed the theme of this
article have extended over many years which have witnessed great
progress in the field of atomic physics. Whether our actual
meetings have been of short or long duration, they have always left
a deep and lasting impression on my mind, and when writing this
report | have, so-to-say, been arguing with Einstein all the time
even when entering on topics apparently far removed from the
special problems under debate at our meetings. As regards the
account of the conversations | am, of course, aware that | am
relying only on my own memory, just as | am prepared for the
possibility that many features of the development of quantum
theory, in which Einstein has played so large a part, may appear to
himself in a different light. | trust, however, that | have not failed in
conveying a proper impression of how much it has meant to me to
be able to benefit from the inspiration which we all derive from
every contact with Einstein.
