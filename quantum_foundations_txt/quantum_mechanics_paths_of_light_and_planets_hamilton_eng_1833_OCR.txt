The law of seeing in straight lines was known from the infancy of optics, being in a
manner forced upon men’s notice by the most familiar and constant experience. It could
not fail to be observed that when a man looked at any object, he had it in his power to
interrupt his vision of that object, and hide it at pleasure from his view, by interposing his
hand between his eyes and it; and that then, by withdrawing his hand, he could see the
object as before: and thus the notion of straight lines or rays of communication, between
a visible object and a seeing eye, must very easily and early have arisen. This notion of
straight lines of vision, was of of course confirmed by the obvious remark that objects can
usually be seen on looking through a straight but not through a bent tube; and the most
familiar facts of perspective supplied, we may suppose, new confirmations and new uses of
the principle. A globe, for example, from whatever point it may be viewed, appears to have a
circular outline; while a plate, or a round table, seems oval when viewed obliquely: and these
facts may have been explained, and reduced to mathematical reasoning, by shewing that the
straight rays or lines of vision, which touch any one given globe and pass through any one
given point, are arranged in a hollow cone of a perfectly circular shape; but that the straight
rays, which connect an eye with the round edge of a plate or table, compose, when they
are oblique, an elliptical or oval cone. The same principle, of seeing in straight lines, must
have been continually employed from the earliest times in the explanation of other familiar
appearances, and in interpreting the testimony of sight respecting the places of visible bodies.
It was, for example, an essential element in ancient as in modern astronomy.

The shapes and sizes of shadows, again, could not fail to suggest the notion of straight
illuminating rays: although opinions, now rejected, respecting the nature of light and vision,
led some of the ancients to distinguish the lines of luminous from those of visual communi-
cation, and to regard the latter as a kind of feelers by which the eye became aware of the
presence of visible objects. It appears, however, that many persons held, even in the infancy
of Optics, the modern view of the subject, and attributed vision, as well as illumination, to
an influence proceeding from the visible or luminous body. But what finally established this
view, and along with it the belief of a finite velocity of progress of the luminous influence,
was the discovery made by Roemer, of the gradual propagation of light from objects to the
eye, in the instance of the satellites of Jupiter; of which we have good reason to believe, from
astronomical observation, that the eclipses are never seen by us, till more than half an hour
after they have happened; the interval, besides, being found to be so much the greater, as
Jupiter is more distant from the Earth. Galileo had indeed proposed terrestrial experiments
to measure the velocity of light, which he believed to be finite; and Des Cartes, who held that

1

--- Page 3 ---
he communication of light was instantaneous, had perceived that astronomical consequences
ought to follow, if the propagation of light were gradual: but experiments such as Galileo
proposed, were not, and could not, be made on a scale sufficient for the purpose; and the
state of astronomical observation in the time of Des Cartes did not permit him to verify the
consequences which he perceived, and seemed rather to justify the use that he made of their
non-verification, as an argument against the opinion with which he had shown them to be
ogically connected. But when astronomers had actually observed appearances, which seemed
and still seem explicable only by this opinion of the gradual propagation of light from objects
o the eye, the opinion itself became required, and was adopted, in the legitimate process of
induction.
By such steps, then, it has become an established theorem, fundamental in optical sci-
ence, that the communication, whether between an illuminating body and a body illuminated,
or between an object seen and a beholding eye, is effected by the gradual but very rapid pas-
sage of some thing, or influence, or state, called light, from the luminous or visible body,
along mathematical or physical lines, usually called rays, and found to be, under the most
common circumstances, exactly or nearly straight.
Again, it was very early perceived that in appearances connected with mirrors, flat or
curved, the luminous or visual communication is effected in bent lines. When we look into a
flat mirror, and seem to see an object, such as a candle, behind it, we should err if we were to
extend to this new case the rules of our more familiar experience. We should not now come to
ouch the candle by continuing the straight line from the eye to a hand or other obstacle, so
placed between the eye and the mirror as to hide the candle; this line continued would meet
he mirror in a certain place from which it would be necessary to draw a new and different
straight line, if we wished to reach the real or tangible candle: and the whole bent line, made
up of these two straight parts, is found to be now the line of visual communication, and is
o be regarded now as the linear path of the light. An opaque obstacle, placed any where on
either part of this bent line, is found to hide the reflected candle from the eye; but an obstacle,
placed any where else, produces no such interruption. And the law was very early discovered,
hat for every such bent line of luminous or visual communication, the angle between any
wo successive straight parts is bisected by the normal, or perpendicular, to the mirror at the
point of bending.
Another early and important observation, was that of the broken or refracted lines of
communication, between an object in water and an eye in air, and generally between a point
in one ordinary medium and a point in another. A valuable series of experiments on such
refraction was made and recorded by Ptolemy; but it was not till long afterwards that the
law was discovered by Snellius. He found that if two lengths, in a certain ratio or proportion
determined by the natures of the two media, be measured, from the point of breaking, or
of bending, on the refracted ray and on the incident ray prolonged, these lengths have one
common projection on the refracting surface, or on its tangent plane. This law of ordinary
refraction has since been improved by Newton’s discovery of the different refrangibility of
the differently coloured rays; and has been applied to explain and to calculate the apparent
elevation of the stars, produced by the atmosphere of the earth.
The phenomena presented by the passage of light through crystals were not observed
until more lately. Bartolinus seems to have been the first to notice the double refraction of
Iceland spar; and Huygens first discovered the laws of this refraction. The more complicated

2

double refraction produced by biaxial crysta’
and the discovery of conical refraction in such
Professor Lloyd on arragonite (undertaken at

s was not observed until the present century;
crystals is still more recent, the experiments of
my request) having been only made last year.

For the explanation of the laws of the linear propagation of light, two principal theories
have been proposed, which still divide the suffrages of scientific men.

The theory of Newton is well known. He compared the propagation of light to the motion
of projectiles; and as, according to that First Law of Motion, of which he had himself estab-
lished the truth by so extensive and beautiful an induction, an ordinary projectile continues
in rectilinear and uniform progress, except so far as its course is retarded or disturbed by the
influence of some foreign body; so, he thought, do luminous and visible objects shoot off little
luminous or light-making projectiles, which then, until they are accelerated or retarded, or
deflected one way or another, by the attractions or repulsions of some refracting or reflecting
medium, continue to move uniformly in straight lines, either because they are not acted on
at all by foreign bodies, or because the foreign actions are nearly equal on all sides, and thus
destroy or neutralise each other. This theory was very generally received by mathematicians
during the last century, and still has numerous supporters.

Another theory however, proposed about the same time by another great philosopher,
has appeared to derive some strong confirmations from modern inductive discoveries. This
other is the theory of Huygens, who compared the gradual propagation of light, not to the
motion of a projectile, but to the spreading of sound through air, or of waves through water.
It was, according to him, no thing, in the ordinary sense, no body, which moved from the
sun to the earth, or from a visible object to the eye; but a state, a motion, a disturbance,
was first in one place, and afterwards in another. As, when we hear a cannon which has
been fired at a distance, no bullet, no particle even of air, makes its way from the cannon
o our ears; but only the aerial motion spreads, the air near the cannon is disturbed first,
hen that which is a little farther, and last of all the air that touches us. Or like the waves
hat spread and grow upon some peaceful lake, when a pebble has stirred its surface; the
floating water-lilies rise and fall, but scarcely quit their place, while the enlarging wave passes
on and moves them in succession. So that great ocean of ether which bathes the farthest
stars, is ever newly stirred, by waves that spread and grow, from every source of light, till
hey move and agitate the whole with their minute vibrations: yet like sounds through air,
or waves on water, these multitudinous disturbances make no confusion, but freely mix and
cross, while each retains its identity, and keeps the impress of its proper origin. Such is the
view of Light which Huygens adopted, and which justly bears his name; because, whatever
kindred thoughts occurred to others before, he first shewed clearly how this view conducted
o the laws of optics, by combining it with that essential principle of the undulatory theory
which was first discovered by himself, the principle of accumulated disturbance.

According to this principle, the minute vibrations of the elastic luminous ether cannot
perceptibly affect our eyes, cannot produce any sensible light, unless they combine and concur
in a great and, as it were, infinite multitude; and on the other hand, such combination is
possible, because particular or secondary waves are supposed in this theory to spread from
every vibrating particle, as from a separate centre, with a rapidity of propagation determined
by the nature of the medium. And hence it comes, thought Huygens, that light in any one
uniform medium diffuses itself only in straight lines, so as only to reach those parts of space
o which a straight path lies open from its origin; because an opaque obstacle, obstructing

3

--- Page 5 ---
such straight progress, though it does not hinder the spreading of weak particular waves
into the space behind it, yet prevents their accumulation within that space into one grand
general wave, of strength enough to generate light. This want of accumulation of separate
vibrations behind an obstacle, was elegantly proved by Huygens: the mutual destruction of
such vibrations by interference, is an important addition to the theory, which has been made
by Young and by Fresnel. Analogous explanations have been offered for the laws of reflexion
and refraction.

Whether we adopt the Newtonian or the Huygenian, or any other physical theory, for the
explanation of the laws that regulate the lines of luminous or visual communication, we may
regard these laws themselves, and the properties and relations of these linear paths of light, as
an important separate study, and as constituting a separate science, called often mathematical
optics. This science of the laws and relations of luminous rays, is, however, itself a branch of
another more general science, which may perhaps be called the Theory of Systems of Rays.
I have published, in the XVth and XVIth volumes of the Transactions of the Royal Irish
Academy, a series of investigations in that theory; and have attempted to introduce a new
principle and method for the study of optical systems. Another supplementary memoir, which
has been lately printed for the same Transactions, will appear in the XVIth volume; but
having been requested to resume the subject here, and to offer briefly some new illustrations
of my view, I shall make some preliminary remarks on the state of deductive optics, and on
he importance of a general method.

The science of optics, like every other physical science, has two different directions of
progress, which have been called the ascending and the descending scale, the inductive and
he deductive method, the way of analysis and of synthesis. In every physical science, we
must ascend from facts to laws, by the way of induction and analysis; and must descend
from laws to consequences, by the deductive and synthetic way. We must gather and groupe
appearances, until the scientific imagination discerns their hidden law, and unity arises from
variety: and then from unity must re-deduce variety, and force the discovered law to utter
its revelations of the future.

It was with such convictions that Newton, when approaching to the close of his optical
abours, and looking back on his own work, remarked, in the spirit of Bacon, that “As in
Mathematics, so in Natural Philosophy, the investigation of difficult things by the method
of Analysis ought ever to precede the method of Composition. This analysis consists in
making experiments and observations, and in drawing general conclusions from them by
induction, and admitting of no objections against the conclusions but such as are drawn
from experiments or other certain truths.” “And although the arguing from experiments
and observations by induction be no demonstration of general conclusions; yet it is the best
way of arguing which the nature of things admits of, and may be looked upon as so much
he stronger, by how much the induction is more general. And if no exception occur from
phenomena, the conclusion may be pronounced generally. But if at any time afterwards,
any exception shall occur from experiments, it may then begin to be pronounced with such
exceptions as occur. By this way of analysis, we may proceed from compounds to ingredients,
and from motions to the forces producing them; and, in general, from effects to their causes,
and from particular causes to more general ones, till the argument end in the most general.
This is the method of analysis: and the synthesis consists in assuming the causes discovered,
and established as principles, and by them explaining the phenomena proceeding from them,

4

--- Page 6 ---
and proving the explanations.” “And if Natural Philosophy in all its parts, by pursuing this
method, shall at length be perfected, the bounds of Moral Philosophy will also be enlarged.
For, so far as we can know by Natural Philosophy, what is the First Cause, what power He
has over us, and what benefits we receive from Him, so far our duty towards Him, as well as
hat towards one another, will appear to us by the light of nature.”

In the science of optics, which has engaged the attention of almost every mathematician
for the last two thousand years, many great discoveries have been attained by both these
ways. It is, however, remarkable that, while the laws of this science admit of being stated
in at least as purely mathematical a form as any other physical results, their mathematical
consequences have been far less fully traced than the consequences of many other laws; and
hat while modern experiments have added so much to the inductive progress of optics, the
deductive has profited so little in proportion from the power of the modern algebra.
It was known to Euclid and to Ptolemy, that the communication between visible objects
and a beholding eye is usually effected in straight lines; and that when the line of communica-
ion is bent, by reflexion, at any point of a plane or of a spheric mirror, the angle of bending
at this point, between the two straight parts of the bent line, is bisected by the normal to the
mirror. It was known also that this law extends to successive reflexions. Optical induction
was therefore sufficiently advanced two thousand years ago, to have enabled a mathematician
o understand, and, so far as depended on the knowledge of physical laws, to resolve the
following problem: to determine the arrangement of the final straight rays, or lines of vision,
along which a shifting eye should look, in order to see a given luminous point, reflected by
a combination of two given spherical mirrors. Yet, of two capital deductions respecting this
arrangement, without which its theory must be regarded as very far from perfect—namely,
hat the final rays are in general tangents to a pair, and that they are perpendicular to a
series of surfaces—the one is a theorem new and little known, and the other is still under
dispute. For Malus, who first discovered that the rays of an ordinary reflected or refracted
system are in general tangents to a pair of caustic surfaces, was led, by the complexity of his
calculations, to deny the general existence (discovered by Huygens) of surfaces perpendicular
to such rays; and the objection of Malus has been lately revived by an eminent analyst of
Italy, in a valuable memoir on caustics, which was published last year in the correspondence
of the observatory of Brussels.

To multiply such instances of the existing imperfection of mathematical or deductive
optics would be an unpleasant task, and might appear an attempt to depreciate the merit
of living mathematicians. It is better to ascend to the source of the imperfection, the want
of a general method, a presiding idea, to guide and assist the deduction. For although the
deductive, as opposed to the inductive process, may be called itself a method, yet so wide
and varied is its range, that it needs the guidance of some one central principle, to give it
continuity and power.

Those who have meditated on the beauty and utility, in theoretical mechanics, of the
general method of Lagrange—who have felt the power and dignity of that central dynamical
theorem which he deduced, in the Méchanique Analytique, from a combination of the prin-
ciple of virtual velocities with the principle of D’Alembert—and who have appreciated the
simplicity and harmony which he introduced into the research of the planetary perturbations,
by the idea of the variation of parameters, and the differentials of the disturbing function,
must feel that mathematical optics can only then attain a coordinate rank with mathemati-

5

--- Page 7 ---
cal mechanics, or with dynamical astronomy, in beauty, power, and harmony, when it shall
possess an appropriate method, and become the unfolding of a central idea.

This fundamental want forced itself long ago on my attention; and I have long been in
possession of a method, by which it seems to me to be removed. But in thinking so, I am
conscious of the danger of a bias. It may happen to me, as to others, that a meditation which
has long been dwelt on shall assume an unreal importance; and that a method which has for
a long time been practised shall acquire an only seeming facility. It must remain for others to
judge how far my attempts have been successful, and how far they require to be completed,
or set aside, in the future progress of the science.
Meanwhile it appears that if a general method in deductive optics can be attained at
all, it must flow from some law or principle, itself of the highest generality, and among the
highest results of induction. What, then, may we consider as the highest and most genera
axiom, (in the Baconian sense,) to which optical induction has attained, respecting the rules
and conditions of the lines of visual and luminous communication? The answer, I think, must
be, the principle or law, called usually the Law of Least Action; suggested by questionable
views, but established on the widest induction, and embracing every known combination of
media, and every straight, or bent, or curved line, ordinary or extraordinary, along which
ight (whatever light may be) extends its influence successively in space and time: namely,
hat this linear path of light, from one point to another, is always found to be such, that if
it be compared with the other infinitely various lines by which in thought and in geometry
he same two points might be connected, a certain integral or sum, called often Action, an
depending by fixed rules on the length, and shape, and position of the path, and on the media
which are traversed by it, is less than all the similar integrals for the other neighbouring lines,
or, at least, possesses, with respect to them, a certain stationary property. From this Law,
hen, which may, perhaps, be named the LAW OF STATIONARY ACTION, it seems that we
may most fitly and with best hope set out, in the synthetic or deductive process, and in
search of a mathematical method.

Accordingly, from this known law of least or stationary action, I deduced (long since)
another connected and coextensive principle, which may be called, by analogy, the LAW OF
VARYING ACTION, and which seems to offer naturally a method such as we are seeking: the
one law being as it were the last step in the ascending scale of induction, respecting linear
paths of light, while the other law may usefully be made the first in the descending and
deductive way. And my chief purpose, in the present paper, is to offer a few illustrations and
consequences of these two coordinate laws.

The former of these two laws was discovered in the following manner. The elementary
principle of straight rays shewed that light, under the most simple and usual circumstances,
employs the direct, and, therefore, the shortest course to pass from one point to another.
Again, it was a very early discovery, (attributed by Laplace to Ptolemy,) that in the case
of a plane mirror, the bent line formed by the incident and reflected rays is shorter than
any other bent line, having the same extremities, and having its point of bending on the
mirror. These facts were thought by some to be instances and results of the simplicity and
economy of nature; and Fermat, whose researches on maxima and minima are claimed by
the continental mathematicians as the germ of the differential calculus, sought anxiously to
trace some similar economy in the more complex case of refraction. He believed that by a
metaphysical or cosmological necessity, arising from the simplicity of the universe, light always

6

--- Page 8 ---
akes the course which it can traverse in the shortest time. To reconcile this metaphysical
opinion with the law of refraction, discovered experimentally by Snellius, Fermat was led to
suppose that the two lengths, or indices, which Snellius had measured on the incident ray
prolonged and on the refracted ray, and had observed to have one common projection on a
refracting plane, are inversely proportional to the two successive velocities of the light before
and after refraction, and therefore that the velocity of light is diminished on entering those
denser media in which it is observed to approach the perpendicular: for Fermat believed that
he time of propagation of light along a line bent by refraction was represented by the sum
of the two products, of the incident portion multiplied by the index of the first medium, and
of the refracted portion multiplied by the index of the second medium; because he found, by
his mathematical method, that this sum was less, in the case of a plane refractor, than if
ight went by any other than its actual path from one given point to another; and because he
perceived that the supposition of a velocity inversely as the index, reconciled his mathematical
discovery of the minimum of the foregoing sum with his cosmological principle of least time.
Des Cartes attacked Fermat’s opinions respecting light, but Leibnitz zealously defended them;
and Huygens was led, by reasonings of a very different kind, to adopt Fermat’s conclusions of
a velocity inversely as the index, and of a minimum time of propagation of light, in passing
from one given point to another through an ordinary refracting plane. Newton, however,
by his theory of emission and attraction, was led to conclude that the velocity of light was
directly, not inversely, as the index, and that it was increased instead of being diminished
on entering a denser medium; a result incompatible with the theorem of shortest time in
refraction. The theorem of shortest time was accordingly abandoned by many, and among
he rest by Maupertuis, who, however, proposed in its stead, as a new cosmological principle,
hat celebrated law of least action which has since acquired so high a rank in mathematical
physics, by the improvements of Euler and Lagrange. Maupertuis gave the name of action to
he product of space and velocity, or rather to the sum of all such products for the various
elements of any motion; conceiving that the more space has been traversed and the less time
it has been traversed in, the more action may be considered to have been expended: and by
combining this idea of action with Newton’s estimate of the velocity of light, as increased by a
denser medium, and as proportional to the refracting index, and with Fermat’s mathematical
heorem of the minimum sum of the products of paths and indices in ordinary refraction at a
plane, he concluded that the course chosen by light corresponded always to the least possible
action, though not always to the least possible time. He proposed this view as reconciling
physical and metaphysical principles, which the results of Newton had seemed to put in
opposition to each other; and he soon proceeded to extend his law of least action to the
phenomena of the shock of bodies. Euler, attached to Maupertuis, and pleased with these
novel results, employed his own great mathematical powers to prove that the law of least
action extends to all the curves described by points under the influence of central forces; or,
o speak more precisely, that if any such curve be compared with any other curve between
he same extremities, which differs from it indefinitely little in shape and in position, and
may be imagined to be described by a neighbouring point with the same law of velocity, and
if we give the name of action to the integral of the product of the velocity and an element of a
curve, the difference of the two neighbouring values of this action will be indefinitely less than
he greatest linear distance (itself indefinitely small) between the two near curves; a theorem
which I think may be advantageously expressed by saying that the action is stationary.

7

--- Page 9 ---
Lagrange extended this theorem of Euler to the motion of a system of points or bodies which
act in any manner on each other; the action being in this case the sum of the masses by the
foregoing integrals. Laplace has also extended the use of the principle in optics, by applying
it to the refraction of crystals; and has pointed out an analogous principle in mechanics, for
all imaginable connexions between force and velocity. But although the law of least action
has thus attained a rank among the highest theorems of physics, yet its pretensions to a
cosmological necessity, on the ground of economy in the universe, are now generally rejected.
And the rejection appears just, for this, among other reasons, that the quantity pretended
to be economised is in fact often lavishly expended. In optics, for example, though the sum
of the incident and reflected portions of the path of light, in a single ordinary reflexion at
a plane, is always the shortest of any, yet in reflexion at a curved mirror this economy is
often violated. If an eye be placed in the interior but not at the centre of a reflecting hollow
sphere, it may see itself reflected in two opposite points, of which one indeed is the nearest
to it, but the other on the contrary is the furthest; so that of the two different paths of light,
corresponding to these two opposite points, the one indeed is the shortest, but the other is
the longest of any. In mathematical language, the integral called action, instead of being
always a minimum, is often a maximum; and often it is neither the one nor the other: though
it has always a certain stationary property, of a kind which has been already alluded to, and
which will soon be more fully explained. We cannot, therefore, suppose the economy of this
uantity to have been designed in the divine idea of the universe: though a simplicity of some
high kind may be believed to be included in that idea. And though we may retain the name
of action to denote the stationary integral to which it has become appropriated—which we
may do without adopting either the metaphysical or (in optics) the physical opinions that
first suggested the name—yet we ought not (I think) to retain the epithet least: but rather
o adopt the alteration proposed above, and to speak, in mechanics and in optics, of the Law
of Stationary Action.

To illustrate this great law, and that other general law, of varying action, which I have
deduced from it, we may conveniently consider first the simple case of rectilinear paths of
ight. For the rectilinear course, which is evidently the shortest of any, is also distinguished
from all others by a certain stationary property, and law of variation, which, being included
in the general laws of stationary and varying action, may serve as preparatory examples.
The length V of any given line, straight or curved, may evidently be denoted by the

following integral:
v= fav = | Varrapra, (1)

If now we pass from this to another neighbouring line, having the same extremities, and
suppose that the several points of the latter line are connected with those of the former, by
equations between their co-ordinates, of the form

Ue = U4 e, Ye =Y FEN, Ze = 24 eG, (2)
€ being any small constant, and €, 7, ¢, being any arbitrary functions of x, y, z, which vanish
for the extreme values of those variables, that is, for the extreme points of the given line, and

do not become infinite for any of the intermediate points, nor for the value ¢ = 0, though

8

--- Page 10 ---
they may in general involve the arbitrary constant ¢; the length V- of the new line may be
represented by the new integral,

Vz =| v@ + dy? + dz2

(3)
= | VEEP yt edi e+ ey,

taken between the same extreme values of x, y, z, as the former; and this new length V. may
be considered as a function of ¢, which tends to the old length V, when « tends to 0, the
quotient

1
=(Ve=V)
tending in general at the same time to a finite limit, which may be thus expressed,

dx dé + dy dn + dz d¢

= — f (cage +nas d— ta case)

he last of these forms being obtained from the preceding by integrating by parts, and by
employing the condition already mentioned, that the functions €, 7, ¢, vanish at the extrem-
ities of the integral. When the original line is such that the limit (4) vanishes, independently
of the forms of the functions €, 7, ¢, and therefore that the difference of the lengths V: — V
bears ultimately an evanescent ratio to the small quantity ¢, (which quantity determines the
difference between the second line and the first, and bears itself a finite ratio to the greatest
distance between these two lines,) we may say that the original line has a stationary length,
V, as compared with all the lines between the same extremities, which differ from it infinitely
ittle in shape and in position. And since it easily follows, from the last form of the limit (4),
hat this limit cannot vanish independently of the forms of €, 7, ¢, unless

lim. =(Ve— V)=

dx dy dz

that is, unless the ratios
dx dy dz

dv’ dv’ dv’
are constant throughout the original line, but that the limit vanishes when this condition is
satisfied, we see that the property of stationary length belongs (in free space) to straight lines
and to such only. The foregoing proof of this property of the straight line may, perhaps, be
useful to those who are not familiar with the Calculus of Variations.

To illustrate, by examples, this stationary property of the length of a straight line, let us
consider such a line as the common chord of a series of circular arcs, and compare its length
with theirs, and theirs with one another. The length of the straight line being called V, let
seV be the height or sagitta of the circular arch upon this chord; so that 3(e +e71)V shall

9

--- Page 11 ---
be the diameter of the circle, and ¢ the trigonometric tangent of the quarter of an arc having
the same number of degrees, to a radius equal to unity: we shall then have the following
expression for the length V- of the circular arch upon the given chord V,

V.=V(e+e')tan.te. (6)

This expression may be put under the form,

V. fe \2 fe ede
—=14+4 d “3 f 7
paita([a) [Sp ©)

which shows not only that the ratio of the circular arch to its chord is always > 1, but also,

that since AV. : : 24
2 =4Vv -3 | —<~_) de, 8
de 0 . o (1+e?)? * 8)

the arch V- increases continually with its height at an increasing rate; its differential coefficient
being positive and increasing, when ¢ is positive and increases, but vanishing with ¢, and
showing, therefore, that in this series of circular arcs and chord the property of stationary
length belongs to the straight line only.

Again, we may imagine a series of semi-ellipses upon a given common axis V, the other
axis conjugate to this being a variable quantity eV. The length of such a semi-elliptic arch is

x

Ve =V ° (cos. 6? + €? sin. 6”)? dé, (9)
0

an expression which may be thus transformed,

weir(fu) [ sin. d? cos. 6? dd _. (10)
Vv 0 0 (cos. g? + €? sin. 2)?

hus the ratio of the elliptic arch V- to its given base or axis V is not only greater than unity,
and continually increases with the height, but increases at an increasing rate, which vanishes
for an evanescent height; so that in this series of semi-elliptic arcs and axis, the latter alone
has the property of stationary length.
In more familiar words, if we construct on a base of a given length, suppose one hundred
feet, a series of circular or of semi-elliptic arches, having that base for chord or for axis, the
engths of those arches will not only increase with their heights, but every additional foot
or inch of height will augment the length more than the foregoing foot or inch had done;
and the lower or flatter any two such arches are made, the less will be the difference of their
engths as compared with the difference of their heights, till the one difference becomes less
han any fraction that can be named of the other. For example, if we construct, on the
supposed base of one hundred feet, two circular arches, the first fifty feet high, the second
fifty-one feet high, of which the first will thus be a semicircle, and the second greater than
a semicircle, the difference of lengths of these two arches will be a little more than double
he difference of their heights, that is, it will be about two feet; but if on the same base we

10

--- Page 12 ---
construct one circular arch with only one foot of height, and another with only two feet, the
difference of lengths of these two low arches will not be quite an inch, though the difference
of their heights remains a foot as before; and if we imagine the two circular arches, on the
same base or common chord of one hundred feet, to have their heights reduced to one and
two inches respectively, the difference of their lengths will thereby be reduced to less than
the hundred-and-fiftieth part of an inch.

We see then that a straight ray, or rectilinear path of light, from one given point to
another, has a stationary length, as compared with all the lines which differ little from it
in shape and in position, and which are drawn between the same extremities. If, however,
we suppose the extremities of the neighbouring line to differ from those of the ray, we shall
then obtain in general a varying instead of stationary length. To investigate the law of this
variation, which is the simplest case of the second general law above proposed to be illustrated,
we may resume the foregoing comparison of the lengths V, V., of any two neighbouring lines;
supposing now that these two lines have different extremities, or in other words, that the
functions €, 7, ¢, do not vanish at the limits of the integral. The integration by parts gives
now, along with the last expression (4) for the limit of

1
the following additional terms,

dx dy dz | da’ | dy’ | dz

Swit at Sav t Sav tay t Sa

which belong to the extremities of the given line, the accented being the initial quantities,
and d’ referring to the infinitesimal changes produced by a motion of the initial point along
the initial element of the line, so that d'V is this initial element taken negatively,

dV =— dla? + diy? + a2? (11)

when, therefore, the last integral (4) vanishes, by the original line being straight, and when
we compare this line with another infinitely near, the law of varying length is expressed by
the following equation:

. 1 dx dy dz d'x' dy’ dz
lim. t t
moe VY) = ap "av iy “ av +" av + ay (42)
= (¢- Seon +(¢- Vs
it may also be thus expressed,
. dx ,. dy -} dz 1
6V WV (6a — 6x") + WV (dy — by’) + qv 62’), (13)

and shows that the length V + 6V of any other line which differs infinitely little from the
straight ray in shape and in position, may be considered as equal to its own projection on
the ray.

11

--- Page 13 ---
It must be observed that in certain singular cases, the distance between two lines may be
made less, throughout, than any quantity assigned, without causing thereby their lengths to
tend to equality. For example, a given straight line may be subdivided into a great number
of small parts, equal or unequal, and on each part a semicircle may be constructed; and then
the waving line composed of the small but numerous semicircumferences will every where be
little distant from the given straight line, and may be made as little distant as we please, to
any degree short of perfect coincidence; while yet the length of the undulating line will not
tend to become equal to the length of the straight line, but will bear to that length a constant
ratio greater than unity, namely the ratio of 7 to 2. But it is evident that such cases as these
are excluded from the foregoing reasoning, which supposes an approach of the one line to the
other in shape, as well as a diminution of the linear distance between them.

From the law of varying length of a straight ray we may easily perceive (what is also
otherwise evident) that the straight rays diverging from a given point 2’ y’ 2’, or converging
to a given point x y z, are cut perpendicularly by a series of concentric spheres, having for
their common equation,

V =const.; (14)

and more generally, that if a set of straight rays be perpendicular to any one surface, they
are also perpendicular to a series of surfaces, determined by the equation (14), that is, by the
condition that the intercepted portion of a ray between any two given surfaces of the series
shall have a constant length. Analogous consequences will be found to follow in general from
the law of varying action.

It may be useful to dwell a little longer on the case of rectilinear paths, and on the con-
sequences of the mathematical conception of luminous or visual communication as a motion
from point to point along a mathematical straight line or ray, before we pass to the properties
of other less simple paths.

It is an obvious consequence of this conception, that from any one point (A), considered as
initial, we may imagine light, if unobstructed, as proceeding to any other point (B), considered
as final, along one determined ray, or linear path; of which the shape, being straight, is the
same whatever point its ends may be; but of which the length and the position depend on
the places of those ends, and admit of infinite variety, corresponding to the infinite variety
that can be imagined of pairs of points to be connected. So that if we express by one set of
numbers the places of the initial and of the final points, and by another set the length and
position of the ray, the latter set of numbers must, in mathematical language, be functions
of the former; must admit of being deduced from them by some fixed mathematical rules.
To make this deduction is an easy but a fundamental problem, which may be resolved in the
following manner.

Let each of the two points A, B, be referred to one common set of three rectangular
semiaxes OX, OY, OZ, diverging from any assumed origin O; let the positive or negative
co-ordinates of the final point B, to which the light comes, be denoted by x, y, z, and let the
corresponding co-ordinates of the initial point A, from which the light sets out, be denoted
similarly by 2’, y’ , z’; let V be the length of the straight ray, or line AB, and let a, 3, y, be
the positive or negative cosines of the acute or obtuse angles which the direction of this ray
makes with the positive semiaxes of co-ordinates: the problem is then to determine the laws
of the functional dependence of the positive number V, and of the three positive or negative

12

--- Page 14 ---
numbers a, 3, y, on the six positive or negative numbers 2, y, z, x’, y’, 2’; and this problem
is resolved by the following evident formule;

rg ee (15)

a—a' y-y Zz

4

It is a simple but important corollary to this solution, that the laws of the three cosines of

direction a, 3, y, expressed by the equations (16), are connected with the law of the length V,
expressed by the formula (15), in a manner which may be stated thus;

a=

(16)

6V 6V 6V

6 being here a characteristic of partial differentiation. We find, in like manner,

éV 8 6V éV
ba!” by!” Soy

= (18)
differentiating the function V with respect to the initial co-ordinates. And since the three
cosines of direction a, 3, y, are evidently connected by the relation

+P +7 =1, (19)

we see that the function V satisfies simultaneously the two following partial differential equa-
tions of the first order and second degree,

(iz) + (ar) +(%2) >
(i) + (5) +) >

The equations (17), (18), (20), will soon be greatly extended; but it seemed well to notice
them here, because they contain the germ of my general method for the investigation of the
paths of light and of the planets, by the partial differential coefficients of one characteristic
function. For the equations (17) and (18), which involve the coefficients of the first order of
the function V, that is, in the present case, of the length, may be considered as equations of
the straight ray which passes with a given direction through a given initial or a given final
point: and I have found analogous equations for all other paths of light, and even for the
planetary orbits under the influence of their mutual attractions.

The equations (16) when put under the form

(20)

v—2/=aV, y-y =BV, 2-2 =V, (21)
give evidently by differentiation
dx =adV, dy= dV, dz=vy7dVv, (22)

13

--- Page 15 ---
and therefore
dV? = dx? + dy? + dz’, (23)

the symbol d referring here to an infinitesimal change of the final point B, by a motion along
the ray prolonged at its extremity; in such a manner that the equations (22) may be regarded
as differential equations of that ray. They give the expressions

dx dy dz
= , B= ; = ; 24
= PFW Ww (24)
which may, by (23), be put under the form
6dV édV édV
=—, B=—, =——, 2
0 Se 8 Fay > tae (25)

6 implying still a partial differentiation, and dV being treated here as a function of dx, dy,
dz. And comparing the expressions (25) and (17), we obtain the following results, which we
shall soon find to be very general, and to extend with analogous meanings to all linear paths
of light,
6V bddV bV bdV bVObdV
da ddx’ dy  dbdy’ bz  bdz°

(26)

It must not be supposed that these equations are identical; for the quantities in the first
members are the partial differential coefficients of one function, V, while those in the second
members are the coefficients of another function dV.

In like manner, if we employ (as before) the characteristic d’ to denote the infinitesimal
changes arising from a change of the initial point A, by a motion along the initial element of
the ray, we have the differential equations

da’ =-ad'V, dy!’ =-6dV, dz =—-yd’V, (27)

d'V being as before the initial element taken negatively, so that

dv? = d' x’? + d'y'? + d'z’?; (28)
we have therefore / ; /

and consequently, by (18),

The same remarks apply to these last results, as to the equations (26).
The general law of stationary action, in optics, may now be thus stated.

14

--- Page 16 ---
The optical quantity called action, for any luminous path having 7 points of sudden
bending by reflexion or refraction, and having therefore i + 1 separate branches, is the sum
of i+ 1 separate integrals,

general case, on the optical properties of that medium, and on the position, direction, and
colour of the element, according to rules discovered by experience, and such, for example,
that if the rth medium be ordinary, v“”) is the index of that medium; so that dV is always a
homogeneous function of the first dimension of the differentials de, dy, dz"), which may
also involve the undifferentiated co-ordinates x) y 2‘) themselves, and has in general a
variation of the form

and

we have also, by the homogeneity of dv,

If we now change the co-ordinates 2) y( z™ of the luminous path to any near con-
nected co-ordinates

15

--- Page 17 ---
to a near line having the same extremities as the luminous path, and having its points of
bending on the same reflecting or refracting surfaces; and the law of stationary action is,
that if we compare the integral or sum, V = > [ dV“), for the luminous path, with the
corresponding integral V- for this near line, the difference of these two integrals or actions
bears an indefinitely small ratio to the quantity ¢, (which makes the one line differ from the

other,) when this quantity ¢ becomes itself indefinitely small: so that we have the limiting
equation,
lim. “(Ve V)= 38)
that is 1 1
lim. 5° (Vs) -V™)=S0 / lim. a (avs? — dv) =0, 39)
or finally

n) being either seminormal to the rth reflecting or refracting surface at the rth point of

itself into the following equations:

and

in which \(7) is an indeterminate multiplier. The three equations (46), which may by the
condition (36) be shown to be consistent with each other, express the gradual changes, if
any, of a ray, between its points of sudden bending; and the equations (47) contain the rules
of ordinary and extraordinary reflexion and refraction. All these results of that known law,
which I have called the law of stationary action, are fully confirmed by experience, when
suitable forms are assigned to the functions denoted by vu").

For example, in the case of an uniform medium, ordinary or extraordinary, the function
v) is to be considered as independent of the undifferentiated co-ordinates 2) y 2), and
the differential equations (46) of the rth portion of the luminous path become simply

do =0, dr =0, dv™ =0, (48)

and give by integration

of
they express, therefore, the known fact of the rectilinear propagation of light in a uniform
medium, because in such a medium o") 7(7) uv depend only on the colour and direction,
but not on the co-ordinates of the path, and are functions of a 6) y™ not including a”

so that a, 8, 7 7), represent the cosines of the inclination (in this case constant) of any
element of the rth portion of the path to the positive semiaxes of co-ordinates. The formulze
(46) give also the known differential equations for a ray in the earth’s atmosphere.

With respect to the rules of reflexion or refraction of light, expressed by the equations
(47), they may in general be thus summed up;

AG”) 41 Ar 41 Av” =0: (51)

17

--- Page 19 ---
in which A refers to the sudden changes produced by reflexion or refraction, and i tw” oe
are the cosines of the inclinations to the positive semiaxes of co-ordinates, of any arbitrary
line t”), which touches the rth reflecting or refracting surface, at the rth point of incidence,
so that

tn) 4 tn” $tOn™ =0. (52)

In the case of ordinary media, for example, we have

and the equation (51) may be put under the form
Avy” =0, (54)

in which
of) =a + BOW 4 OW”, (55)

so that the unchanged quantity wou” is the projection of the index v‘”) on the arbitrary
tangent ¢), each index being measured from the point of incidence in the direction of the
corresponding ray: which agrees with the law of Snellius. In general, if we put

yp = VJolr)2 + qr(r)2 + v(r)2, (56

and
DM = Uy, rn) = YOY), yn) = Uy, (57

we may consider a) 7‘") v™ as the projections, on the axes of co-ordinates, of a certain
straight line v‘”), of which the length and direction depend (according to rules expressed by
the foregoing equations) on the form of the function v” or dV, and on the direction an
colour of the element of the luminous path, before or after incidence; and if we put

6) = OO 4 LU 4 OW, (58
the equation (51) will take the form
Avy” =0, (59)

which expresses that the projection of this straight line v“) on any arbitrary tangent t) to
the reflecting or refracting surface, at the point of incidence, is not changed by reflection or
refraction, ordinary or extraordinary: which is a convenient general form for all the known
rules of sudden change of direction of a path of light. In the undulatory theory, I have found
that the line v) is the reciprocal of the normal velocity of propagation of the wave; and
its projections may therefore be called components of normal slowness: so that the foregoing
property of unchanged projection of the line v‘”), may be expressed, in the language of this
theory, by saying that the component of normal slowness in the direction of any line which
touches any ordinary or extraordinary reflecting or refracting surface at any point of incidence

18

--- Page 20 ---
is not changed by reflection or refraction. It was, however, by a different method that I
originally deduced this general enunciation of the rules of optical reflexion and refraction,
namely, by employing my principle of the characteristic function, and that other general law,
of which it is now time to speak.

This other general law, the law of varying action, results from the known law above
explained, by considering the extreme points of a luminous path as variable: that is, by not
supposing the six extreme functions (43) to vanish. Denoting, for abridgment, the three final
functions of this set by € 71 ¢, and the three initial functions by €/ 7 ¢’, and writing similarly
v, dV, &c., instead of the final quantities v’+), dVv@*), &e. and vu’, dV’, &c., instead of
the initial quantities _ dV), &c., we find this new equation,

baVve”
lim. 5 (V-—V) -r/(4 (60)

ordinates, that is, from a motion of the initial point 2’ y’ z’ along the initial element of the
luminous path; so that d’V is the initial element of the integral taken negatively,

dV =-v'V/d'e?2 + dy? +d'2. (64)

19

, &e.;

--- Page 21 ---
If then we consider the integral or action V as a function (which I have called the characteristic
function) of the six extreme co-ordinates, and if we differentiate this function with respect to
these co-ordinates, we see that its six partial differential coefficients of the first order may be
represented generally by the equations (26) and (30), which were already proved to be true
for the simple case of rectilinear paths of light. And as, in that simple case, those equations,
being then equivalent to the formulae (17) and (18), were seen to determine the course of the
straight ray, which passed with a given direction through a given initial or a given final point;
so, generally, when we know the initial co-ordinates, direction, and colour of a luminous path,
and the optical properties of the initial medium, we can determine, or at least restrict (in
general) to a finite variety, the values of the initial coefficients

6d’V bd'V bd'V

which form the second members of the equations (30); and therefore we may regard as known
the first members of the same equations, namely the partial differential coefficients

of the characteristic function V, taken with respect to the known initial co-ordinates: so
that if the form of the function V be known, we have between the final co-ordinates x, y,
z, considered as variable, the three following equations of the path, or at least of its final
branch,
éV 6 éV

ba! by’ “62! (65)
These three equations are compatible with each other, and are equivalent only to two distinct
relations between the variable co-ordinates x y z, because in general V must satisfy a partial
differential equation of the form

O= O'(o'7,7',u', ay’, 2’), (66)

= const.,

in which, by what has been shown,

6V. éV éV

and which is therefore analogous to the second formula (20): this equation (66) being obtained
by eliminating the ratios of d'z’, d’y’, d'z’, between the general formulze (30). In like manner
the formulee (26) give generally a partial differential equation of the form

6V 6V é6V

analogous to the first of those marked (20), and the three following compatible equations

between the variable initial co-ordinates 2x’, y’, z’, of a path of light which is obliged to pass
with a given direction through a given final point,

--- Page 22 ---
But for the integration and use of these partial differential equations, the limits of the present
communication oblige me to refer to the volumes, already mentioned, of the Transactions of
the Royal Irish Academy.

I may, however, mention here, that my employment of the characteristic function V, in
all questions of reflexion and refraction, is founded on an equation in finite differences, which,
by the integral nature of this function V, is evidently satisfied, namely,

AV =0=u; (70)

A referring, as before, to the sudden changes produced at any reflecting or refracting surface
having for its equation
u=0; (71)

and A being an indeterminate multiplier, employed for the purpose of being able to treat the
co-ordinates of incidence as three independent variables. For example, the formulae (47), for
a sudden change of direction, result immediately from (70), under the form

6V éu 6V éu éV éu

A— =A—, A— =)\—, A— = \—, 72

ba 6x éy by’ éz éz (72)
by differentiating with respect to the co-ordinates of incidence, as three independent variables,
and then reducing by the equation (71) of the ordinary or extraordinary reflecting or refracting
surface. These results respecting the change of direction of a luminous path may be put under
the form

6V 6Vv 6V

or under the following,

and in general, all theorems respecting the changes produced by reflexion or refraction in
the properties of an optical system, may be expressed, by the help of the formula (70), as
permanences of certain other properties. The remarkable permanence, already stated, of the
components of normal slowness of propagation of a luminous wave, was suggested to me by
observing that my function V is (in the undulatory theory) the time of propagation of light
from the initial to the final point, and therefore that the waves (in the same theory) are
represented by the general equation

V = const., (75)

and the components of normal slowness by the partial differential coefficients of V of the
first order. The properties of the function V, on which my whole optical method depends,

21

--- Page 23 ---
supplied me also, long since, with a simple proof of the contested theorem of Huygens already
mentioned, namely, that the rays of any ordinary homogeneous system, which after issuing
originally from any luminous point, or being (in an initial and ordinary state) perpendicular
to any common surface, have undergone any number of reflexions or refractions ordinary or
extraordinary, before arriving at their final state, are in that state perpendicular to a series
of surfaces, namely, to the series (75), which are waves in the theory of Huygens: because,
by the properties of my function, the differential equation of that series is

adxz+ Bdy+76z=0, (76)

a, 6 and y being the cosines which determine the final direction of a ray. It was also by
combining the properties of the same characteristic function V with the physical principles
of Fresnel, that I was first led, (from perceiving an indeterminateness in two particular cases
in the relations between the coefficients

6édV b6dV bdV.
édx’  ddy’— bdz’

and the ratios of dx, dy, dz,) to form that theoretical expectation of two kinds of conical
refraction which I communicated in last October (1832) to the Royal Irish Academy and to
Professor Lloyd, and which the latter has since verified experimentally. Mr. MacCullagh has
lately informed me that the same two indeterminate cases in Fresnel’s theory had occurred
to him from geometrical considerations, some years ago, and that he had intended to try to
what geometrical and physical consequences they would lead.

The method of the characteristic function has conducted me to many other consequences,
besides those which I have already published in the Transactions of the Royal Irish Academy:
and I think that it will hereafter acquire, in the hands of other mathematicians, a rank in
deductive optics, of the same kind as that which the method of co-ordinates has attained in
algebraical geometry. For as, by the last-mentioned method, Des Cartes reduced the study
of a plane curve, or of a curved surface, to the study of that one function which expresses
he law of the ordinate, and made it possible thereby to discover general formule for the
angents, curvatures, and all other geometrical properties of the curve or surface, and to
regard them as included all in that one law, that central algebraical relation: so I believe
hat mathematicians will find it possible to deduce all properties of optical systems from
he study of that one central relation which connects, for each particular system, the optical
function V with the extreme co-ordinates and the colour, and which has its partial differential
coefficients connected with the extreme directions of a ray, by the law of varying action, or
by the formule (26) and (30).
It only now remains, in order to conclude the present remarks, that I should briefly
explain the allusions already made to my view of an analogous function and method in the
research of the planetary and cometary orbits under the influence of their mutual perturba-
ions. The view itself occurred to me many years ago, and I gave a short notice or announce-
ment of it in the XVth volume (page 80) of the Transactions of the Royal Irish Academy; but
I have only lately resumed the idea, and have not hitherto published any definite statement
on the subject.

To begin with a simple instance, let us attend first to the case of a comet, considered
as sensibly devoid of mass, and as moving in an undisturbed parabola about the sun, which
latter body we shall regard as fixed at the origin of co-ordinates, and as having an attracting
mass equal to unity. Let r be the comet’s radius vector at any moment t considered as final,
and r’ the radius vector of the same comet at any other moment ¢’ considered as initial; let
also r” be the chord joining the ends of r and r’, and let us put for abridgment

V=2Vrtrl tr! se @Wr+rl— 47"; (77)

then I find, that the final and initial components of velocity of the comet, parallel to any
three rectangular semiaxes of co-ordinates, may be expressed as follows by the coefficients of
the function V,

dx 6V dy_ OSV dz &V

and that this function V satisfies the two following partial differential equations,
(x) (~) (x) 2
6: 6 6 a:
x ; y ; z ; r (79)
6V\"  (éV\"  (oV\" 2

which reconcile the expressions (78) with the known law of a comet’s velocity. I find also
that all the other properties of a comet’s parabolic motion agree with and are included in the
formulee (78), when the form (77) is assigned to the function V. They give, for example, by
an easy combination, the theorem discovered by Euler for the dependence of the time (t — t’)
on the parabolic chord (r”) and on the sum (r +r’) of the radii drawn to its extremities.

More generally, in any system of points or bodies which attract or repel one another
according to any function of the distance, for example, in the solar system, I have found
that the final and initial components of momentum may be expressed in a similar manner,
by the partial differential coefficients of the first order of some one central or characteristic
function V of the final and initial co-ordinates; so that we have generally, by a suitable choice
of V,

m1, Mz, &c., being the masses of the system, and the function V being obliged to satisfy
two partial differential equations of the first order and second degree, which are analogous to
(79), and may be thus denoted

the function F involving the final co-ordinates, and the function F’ involving similarly the
initial co-ordinates, and the common form of these two functions depending on the law of
attraction or repulsion. In the solar system

H being a certain constant; and in general the partial differential equations (82) contain the

law of living forces, which the other known general laws or integrals of the equations of motion
are expressed by other general and simple properties of the same characteristic function V: the
coefficients of which function, when combined with the relations (80) and (81), are sufficient to
determine all circumstances of the motion of a system. By this view the research of the most
complicated orbits, in lunar, planetary, and sidereal astronomy, is reduced to the study of the
properties of a single function V; which is analogous to my optical function, and represents the
action of the system from one position to another. If we knew, for example, the form of this
one function V for a system of three bodies attracting according to Newton’s law, (suppose
the system of Sun, Earth, and Moon, or of the Sun, Jupiter and Saturn,) we should need no
further integration in order to determine the separate paths and the successive configurations
of these three bodies; the eight relations, independent of the time, between their nine variable
co-ordinates, would be given at once by differentiating the one function V, and employing the
nine initial equations of the form (81), which in consequence of the second equation (82) are
only equivalent to eight distinct relations, the positions and velocities being given for some
one initial epoch; and the variable time t of arriving at any one of the subsequent states of
the system would be given by a single integration of any combination of these relations with
the equations (80). The development of this view, including its extension to other analogous
questions, appears to me to open in mechanics and astronomy an entirely new field of research.
I shall only add, that the view was suggested by a general law of varying action in dynamics,
which I had deduced from the known dynamical law of least or stationary action, by a process
analogous to that general reasoning in optics which I have already endeavoured to illustrate.
