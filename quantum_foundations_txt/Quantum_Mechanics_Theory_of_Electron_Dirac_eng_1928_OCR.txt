The Quantum Theory of the Electron.

By P. A. M. Dirac, St. John’s College, Cambridge.
(Communicated by R. H. Fowler, F.R.S.—Received January 2, 1928.)

The new quantum mechanics, when applied to the problem of the structure
of the atom with point-charge electrons, does not give results in agreement
with experiment. The discrepancies consist of “ duplexity ” phenomena, the
observed number of stationary states for an electron in an atom being twice
the number given by the theory. To meet the difficulty, Goudsmit and Uhlen-
beck have introduced the idea of an electron with a spin angular momentum
of half a quantum and a magnetic moment of one Bohr magneton. This model
for the electron has been fitted into the new mechanics by Pauli,* and Darwin,
working with an equivalent theory, has shown that it gives results in agreement
with experiment for hydrogen-like spectra to the first order of accuracy.

The question remains as to why Nature should have chosen this particular

model for the electron instead of being satisfied with the point-charge. One
would like to find some incompleteness in the previous methods of applying
quantum mechanics to the point-charge electron such that, when removed,
the whole of the duplexity phenomena follow without arbitrary assumptions.
In the present paper it is shown that this is the case, the incompleteness of

the previous theories lying in their disagreement with relativity, or, alternate-
tively, with the general transformation theory of quantum mechanics. It
appears that the simplest Hamiltonian for a point-charge electron satistying
the requirements of both relativity and the general transformation theory
leads to an explanation of all duplexity phenomena without further assumption.
All the same there is a great deal of truth in the spinning electron model, at
least as a first approximation. The most important failure of the model seems
to be that the magnitude of the resultant orbital angular momentum of an
electron moving in an orbit in a central field of force is not a constant, as the
model leads one to expect.

$1. Previous Relativity Treatments.

The relativity Hamiltonian according to the classical theory for a point
electron moving in an arbitrary electro-magnetic field with scalar potential Ay
and vector potential A is

F= (@ + £ay) + (p + < Ay + mec,

where p is the momentum vector. It has been suggested by Gordon* that the
operator of the wave equation of the quantum theory should be obtained from
this F by the same procedure as in non-relativity theory, namely, by putting

1 0
the

mathe, 1H,

W=

in it. This gives the wave equation

the wave function ~) being a function of 21, 2, 23, t. This gives rise to two
difficulties. :

The first is in connection with the physical interpretation of J. Gordon,
and also independently Klein,} from considerations of the conservation theorems,
make the assumption that if },,, |, are two solutions

— “fa ( 1 (duds 7, 288) | 2ebobada}

and

@ 7 - = A --
In = = {— ih (dy grad Go—G, grad Yq) +2 £ Anda da}
are to be interpreted as the charge and current associated with the transition
m->%n. This appears to be satisfactory so far as emission and absorption of
radiation are concerned, but is not so general as the interpretation of the non-
relativity quantum mechanics, which has been developed{ sufficiently to enable
one to answer the question : What is the probability of any dynamical variable

at any specified time having a value lying between any specified limits, when the
system is represented by a given wave function |)? The Gordon-Klein inter-
pretation can answer such questions if they refer to the position of the electron
(by the use of o,.), but not if they refer to its momentum, or angular momentum
or any other dynamical variable. We should expect the interpretation of the
relativity theory to be just as general as that of the non-relativity theory.

The general interpretation of non-relativity quantum mechanics is based on
the transformation theory, and is made possible by the wave equation being of
the form , .

(H — W) } = 0, (2)
ie., being linear in W or 0/0, so that the wave function at any time determines
the wave function at any later time. The wave equation of the relativity
theory must also be linear in W if the general interpretation is to be possible.

The second difficulty in Gordon’s interpretation arises from the fact that if
one takes the conjugate imaginary of equation (1), one gets

[[- E+ ga +(- e+ gay tmelema

which is the same as one would get if one put —e fore. The wave equation

(1) thus refers equally well to an electron with charge e as to one with charge
—e. If one considers for definiteness the limiting case of large quantum numbers
one would find that some of the solutions of the wave equation are wave packets
moving in the way a particle of charge — e would move on the classical theory,
while others are wave packets moving in the way a particle of charge e would
move classically. For this second class of solutions W has a negative value.
One gets over the difficulty on the classical theory by arbitrarily excluding
those solutions that have a negative W. One cannot do this on the quantum
theory, since in general a perturbation will cause transitions from states with
W positive to states with W negative. Such a transition would appear experi-
mentally as the electron suddenly changing its charge from —e to e, a
phenomenon which has not been observed. The true relativity wave equation
should thus be such that its solutions split up into two non-combining sets,
referring respectively to the charge — e and the charge e.

In the present paper we shall be concerned only with the removal of the first
of these two difficulties. The resulting theory is therefore still only an approxi-
mation, but it appears to be good enough to account for all the duplexity
phenomena without arbitrary assumptions.

§2. The Hamilionian for No Field.

Our problem is to obtain a wave equation of the form (2) which shall be
invariant under a Lorentz transformation and shall be equivalent to (1) in the
limit of large quantum numbers. We shall consider first the case of no field,
when equation (1) reduces to

(— p+ p? + mick) | = 0 (3)
if one puts
=Wig2
ras

The symmetry between py and p,, Po, Ps required by relativity shows that,
since the Hamiltonian we want is linear in yo, it must also be linear in 9,, po
and pz. Our wave equation is therefore of the form

(Po +P: + %2P2 + taps + B) b = 0, (4)
where for the present all that is known about the dynamical variables or
operators 0%, %, %3, 8 is that they are independent of Mo, );, Po, Pz, 2.€., that they
commute with ¢, 2, %», %. Since we are considering the case of a particle
moving in empty space, so that all points in space are equivalent, we should
expect the Hamiltonian not to involve t, 7, %, 23. This means that «4, a,
&%g, & are independent of ¢, x, %g, %g, 4.¢., that they commute with pp, 71, Po,
pz We are therefore obliged to have other dynamical variables besides the
co-ordinates and momenta of the electron, in order that «,, %2, «3, @ may be
functions of them. The wave function ) must then involve more variables
than merely 1, %, Ws, t.

Equation (4) leads to

0 = (— po t+ py + &ePo + MPs + B) (Po + Py + %eP2 + &3P3 + B)
= [pe + Lah? +E (4429 + 2%) MPs + B+ B (B+ Boy) pl, (5)

where the & refers to cyclic permutation of the suffixes 1, 2,3. This agrees with
(3) if
a? = 1, OtyOts + Oty = O (4 #8) °
r,s = 1, 2,3.
G2 = mPc?, ay + Boy = 0
If we put 8 = ame, these conditions become
2 = 1 Oyty + Hep, = O (ux v) vu, v= 1, 2, 3, 4. (6)

We can suppose the «,’s to be expressed as matrices in some matrix scheme.
pp a Pp y
the matrix elements of «, being, say, %, (¢’ ¢”). The wave function ) must

now be a function of ¢ as well as x,, 72, #3, t. The result of «, multiplied into )
will be a function (x, )) of 2, #, ag, t, ¢ defined by

(a) (a, t, 9) = Ly on 4 ¢) v (a, t, ¢’).

We must now find four matrices «, to satisfy the conditions (6). We make
use of the matrices

01 0-i 1 0
oy = o,=(— O35
1 0, i 0 0-1

which Pauli introduced* to describe the three components of spin angular
momentum. These matrices have just the properties

oP = 1 G55 + G50, = 0, (7 # 8), (7)

that we require for our «’s. We cannot, however, just take the o’s to be three
of our «’s, because then it would not be possible to find the fourth. We must
extend the o’s in a diagonal manner to bring in two more rows and columns,
so that we can introduce three more matrices 9,, 95, e3 of the same form as
Oj, Og, G3, but referring to different rows and columns, thus :—

o=f(0 1 0 0) o=f0 -i 0 °| o3=(1 0 0 0)

1 0 0 0 i 0 0 0 0-1 0 O|

1 0 0 0 i 0 0 0 0 0-1 0
lo 1 0 0J lo «0 oJ} 0 60 0-1

The ’s are obtained from the o’s by interchanging the second and third rows,
and the second and third columns. We now have, in addition to equations (7)

oP = Pr0s + PsP = 9 (#8), )
| 5 (7)

and also
PrTt = TtPy-

If we now take
= 0191 2 = P1S2, OX = 0193, Oy = Pgs
all the conditions (6) are satisfied, ¢.g.,

2 — 26.2 —
Oy” = 9404910, = po," = 1

The following equations are to be noted for later reference

0182 = 03 = — 201
, (8)

0459 = og = — 0,0,
together with the equations obtained by cyclic permutation of the suffixes.
The wave equation (4) now takes the form
[pot 01 (F, P) + pgme] p =0, (9)

where o denotes the vector (61, 62, 63).

§ 3. Proof of Invariance under a Lorentz Transformation.

Multiply equation (9) by e3 on the left-hand side. It becomes, with the help
of (8),
[esPo + tes (1p, + 622+ ogps) + me] p = 0.

Putting
Po= Py
P3=Ya Pr =Yn =r =I, 2, 3, (10)
we have .
[DyePat me] b=0, w=, 2,3,4. (11)

The p, transform under a Lorentz transformation according to the law
Pu! = ZL dwyPr,
where the coefficients a,, are c-numbers satisfying
LG Our = Sir5 Lyle = Spy.

The wave equation therefore transforms into

[t2yy'pul + me] b =0, (12)
where
Yul = DiGyur\r-
Now the y,, like the «,, satisfy

W=1, Wi be =9, (pA).

These relations can be summed up in the single equation
We + Yen = uw
We have . . .
alte” Bye! = Zan Gur Or (Vx -F Yar)
= 2D pa Our bya Sra

= Wy diye Oye = Wyre

Thus the y,’ satisfy the same relations as the y,. Thus we can put, analogously
to (10)
va = Ps" Yr = P27

where the o’’s and o’’s are easily verified to satisfy the relations corresponding
to (7), (7’) and (8), if g9’ and ;’ are defined by ge’ = — ty1'y2"7s', 91. = — tpe’ps’:

We shall now show that, by a canonical transformation, the p”’s and o”s
may be brought into the form of the p’s and o’s. From the equation pe,” = I,
it follows that the only possible characteristic values for p,’ are-++1. If one
applies to gp,’ a canonical transformation with the transformation function 9’,
the result is

01/03 (er) + = — p2’py’ (ey) t = — 0

Since characteristic values are not changed by a canonical transformation,
g3/ must have the same characteristic values as — p,’. Hence the characteristic
values of p,/ are + 1 twice and — 1 twice. The same argument applies to each
of the other 9”’s, and to each of the o’’s.

Since pe,’ and,’ commute, they can be brought simultaneously to the diagonal
form by a canonical transformation. They will then have for their diagonal
elements each + 1 twice and —1 twice. Thus, by suitably rearranging the
tows and columns, they can be brought into the form e, and og respectively.
(The possibility 9,’ = -+ o3' is excluded by the existence of matrices that
commute with one but not with the other.)

Any matrix containing four rows and columns can be expressed as

© A Lylpoy + Lily’ Py + VyslrsPrFs (13)

where the sixteen coefficients c, ¢,, ¢,’, C,, are cnumbers. By expressing o,'
in this way, we see, from the fact that it commutes with 9,’ = 3 and anti-
commutes* with os’ = 3, that it must be of the form

,
Gy = 6,6, + CQ6q ++ 6310301 + Cg203Fe,

* We say that a anticommutes with b when ab == — ba.

t.e., of the form

0 0 0 digg
lO 0 a, 0 |
The condition o)? = 1 shows that ayo4, = 1, @gyayg3== 1. If we now apply
the canonical transformation : first row to be multiplied by (@2,/4,2)* and third
row to be multiplied by (a43/¢3,)?, and first and third columns to be divided
by the same expressions, o,’ will be brought into the form of o,, and the diagonal
matrices o,’ and 9,’ will not be changed.

If we now express ,’ in the form (13) and use the conditions that it commutes
with o,/ =o, and o,’ =, and anticommutes with 9,’ = p3, we see that it
must be of the form

er) = y'0y + C9’ pe.

The condition oe, = 1 shows that c, + c= 1, or ¢,/ = cos 0, ¢’ = sin 0.
Hence p,’ is of the form

If we now apply the canonical transformation : first and second rows to be
multiplied by e® and first and second columns to be divided by the same
expression, 9,’ will be brought into the form ,, and oj, o3, es will not be altered.
2, and oy’ must now be of the form pe, and og, on account of the relations
tps’ = 03/01’, tog’ = 0,'0y’.

Thus by a succession of canonical transformations, which can be combined
to form a single canonical transformation, the e”s and o’’s can be brought into
the form of the 9’s and o’s. The new wave equation (12) can in this way be
brought back into the form of the original wave equation (11) or (9), so that
the results that follow from this original wave equation must be independent
of the frame of reference used.

§4. The Hamiltoman for an Arbitrary Field,

To obtain the Hamiltonian for an electron in an electromagnetic field with
scalar potential Ay and vector potential A, we adopt the usual procedure of
substituting py + e/c. Ay for py and p+ e/e.A.for p in the Hamiltonian
for no field. From equation (9) we thus obtain

[p+ £A0+ a(e,p+2a)+ pyme | = 0. (14)

This wave equation appears to be sufficient to account for all the duplexity
phenomena. On account of the matrices p and o containing four rows and
columns, it will have four times as many solutions as the non-relativity wave
equation, and twice as many as the previous relativity wave equation (1).
Since half the solutions must be rejected as referring to the charge + ¢ on the
electron, the correct number will be left to account for duplexity phenomena.
The proof given in the preceding section of invariance under a Lorentz trans-
formation applies equally well to the more general wave equation (14).

We can obtain a rough idea of how (14) differs from the previous relativity
wave equation (1) by multiplying it up analogously to (5). This gives, if we
write e’ for e/c

0 = [— (po + Ag) + 01(o, P+ eA) + page]
X [(Po + eo) + e1(F, P+e'A) + pgmel Y
= [— (pp + e'Ap)? +(e, p+ eA)? + mic?
Ferl(o, P+ eA) (Po + ee) — (Pot eA) (S, P+eAIY. (15)

We now use the general formula, that if B and C are any two vectors that com-
mute with o
(o, B)(o, C) = 2 of BC, +E (6,92 B,C, + 026, BLCy)
= (B, C)+7 Xo, (B,C, — B,C,)
= (B, C)+i(c,BxC). (16)

Taking B= C = p+e’A, we find

(o,p+eA = (p+eAP+idos
(pit e'Ay) (Po + e’Ay) — (Po + e’Ag)(py + eA,)]
= (p+ e’A)®-+ he’ (co, curl A).

Thus (15) becomes
0=[—(, 4 eAy)? + (pt eA + mck -+ eho, curl A)

—teho, (<, grad Ay + t a) y

[— (po +e'Ao)?® + (p+ eA)? + mic? + eh (oe, H) + te’he,(, E)] $,
where E and H are the electric and magnetic vectors of the field.
This differs from (1) by the two extra terms

fo, n) +o (0, 8)

in F. These two terms, when divided by the factor 2m, can be regarded as the
additional potential energy of the electron due to its new degree of freedom.
The electron will therefore behave as though it has a magnetic moment ¢h/2me. o
and an electric moment ieh/2mc.e,o. This magnetic moment is just that
assumed in the Spinning electron model. The electric moment, being a pure
imaginary, we should not expect to appear in the model. It is doubtful whether
the electric moment has any physical meaning, since the Hamiltonian in (14)
that we started from is real, and the imaginary part only appeared when we
multiplied it up in an artificial way in order to make it resemble the Hamiltonian.
of previous theories.

§5. The Angular Momentum Integrals for Motion in a Central Field.

We shall consider in greater detail the motion .of an electron in a central
field of force. We put A =0 and e’Ap = V(r), an arbitrary function of the
radius 7, so that the Hamiltonian in (14) becomes

FE pot V+ e(o, p) + eye.
We shall determine the periodic solutions of the wave equation F ) = 0, which
means that py is to be counted as a parameter instead of an operator ; it is, in
fact, just 1/c times the energy level.

We shall first find the angular momentum integrals of the motion. The
orbital angular momentum m is defined by

m=x X p,
and satisfies the following ‘“‘ Vertauschungs ”’ relations

M0, — 2m, = 0; My — Lym, = tha:
‘1/1 ohhhe 12 2m 3

MP, — Pym = 0, MP, — Pm, = thps ¢>» (17)

mxXm=ihm, m’m,—mm?=0, J

620 P, A. M. Dirac.

together with similar relations obtained by permuting the suffixes. Also m
commutes with 7, and with p,, the momentum canonically conjugate to 7.
We have
mE — Fm, = ey (1m (F, B) —(F, p) m,}
=, (S, mP — pm)
= tho, (6293 — 532),
and so ;
mF — I'm = the,  X Pp. (18)

Thus m is nof a constant of the motion. We have further
oF — Fo, = 9, {o,(9,p) —(, p) a}

= 9, (0,5 — F6, P)

= 2ipy (G32 — O2Ps)s
with the help of (8), and so

oF —Fo = — 2%, ox p.
Hence
(m+ 4ho)F—F(m+ fhe) =0.

Thus m -+ 44 (= M say) is a constant of the motion. We can interpret this
result by saying that the electron has a spin angular momentum of $4, which,
added to the orbital angular momentum m, gives the total angular momentum
M, which is a constant of the motion.

The Vertauschungs relations (17) all hold when M’s are written for the m’s.

In particular
MxM=thM and M?M, = M,M?.

Ms; will be an action variable of the system. Since the characteristic values of
mg must be integral multiples of in order that the wave function may be
single-valued, the characteristic values of M, must be half odd integral multiples
of h. If we put :

MP = (7? — a) R?, (19)
j will be another quantum number, and the characteristic values of M, will
extend from (j — 4)h to (—j + 4)4.* Thus j takes integral values.

One easily verifies from (18) that m? does not commute with F, and is thus
not a constant of the motion. This makes a difference between the present
theory and the previous spinning electron theory, in which m? is constant,
and defines the azimuthal quantum number & by a relation similar to (19).
We shall find that our j plays the same part as the & of the previous theory.

§6. The Energy Levels for Motion in a Central Field.

We shall now obtain the wave equation as a differential equation in r, with
the variables that specify the orientation of the whole system removed. We
can do this by the use only of elementary non-commutative algebra in the
following way.

In formula (16) take B= C=m. This gives

(¢, m)?=m%+7(c,m x m) (20)
=(m-+thkoY—h(o, m)— o2—h(o, m)

== M? — 2h(¢, m) — 3h.
Hence

{(o, m) + A}? = M2 + Ye = pe

Up to the present we have defined j only through 7”, so that we could now, if
we liked, take jh equal to (@, m) -++-h. This would not be convenient since we
want j to be a constant of the motion while (o, m) +f is not, although its
square is. We have, in fact, by another application of (16),

(e, m)(o, p)=71(o, mx p)
since (m, p) = 0, and similarly

(o, p)(o, m)=7(e, p x m),
so that

(o,m)(o,p)+(o, p) (o, m) = 2d, (maps — Msp. + Pog — Paglia)
= 1X0, . 2thp, = —2h(e, p),
or
{(o, m) +2} (¢, p)-+(¢, p) {(e, m) + A} =0.
Thus (¢, m) -+ A anticommutes with one of the terms in F, namely, e, (¢, p),
and commutes with the other three. Hence pe, {(o, m) + 4} commutes with all
four, and is therefore a constant of the motion. But the square of p,{( o, m)--A}
must also equal j?h?. We therefore take
gh = eg{(F, m) +h}. (21)
We have, by a further application of (16)
(o, x) (o, p) = (x, Pp) +74 (oe, m).
Now a permissible definition of p, is
(x, Pp) == rp, + th,
and from (21)
(o, m) = psjh — h.

Hence

(o, X)(o, D) = 1p + tpgjh. (22)

Introduce the quantity < defined by
re = py (a, X). (23)

Since 7 commutes with p, and with (o, x), it must commute with c. We thus
have
Pe =[p)(c,x)P=(o,xP= x= 7?
or
== 1.

Since there is symmetry between x and p so far as angular momentum is con-

cerned, o, (&, x), like 9, (@, p), must commute with M andj. Hence ¢ com-

mutes with M andj. Further, ¢ must commute with p,, since we have
(, x) (x, P) — (&, Pp) (o, x) = th(, x),

which gives

re (rp, + th) — (rp, + th) re = thre,
which reduces to :

Py — Pre = 0.
From (22) and (23) we now have

769, (O, P) = My + tpggh
or
01 (, P) = ep, + tepsjh/r.
Thus
F = po + V + ep, + tepggh/r -+ egme. (24)

Equation (23) shows that ¢ anticommutes with o3. We can therefore by a
canonical transformation (involving perbaps the 2’s and p’s as well as the o’s
and ¢’s) bring ¢ into the form of the op, of § 2 without changing p3, and without
changing any of the other variables occurring on the right-hand side of (24),
since these other variables all commute with ¢. dep, will now be of the form
503 = — (4, 80 that the wave equation takes the form

Fu = [po + V + cape — ersh/r + pgme] p = 0.

If we write this equation out in full, calling the components of referring to
the first and third rows (or columns) of the matrices |, and tg respectively,
we get

If one neglects the last term, which is small on account of B being large, this
equation becomes the same as the ordinary Schroedinger equation for the system,
with relativity correction included. Since j has, from its definition, both
positive and negative integral characteristic values, our equation will give
twice as many energy levels when the last term is not neglected.

We shall now compare the last term of (26), which is of the same order of
magnitude as the relativity correction, with the spin correction given by Darwin
and Pauli. To do this we must eliminate the dy/dr term by a further trans-
formation of the wave function. We put

which agrees with (28) and (28’). The present theory will thus, in the first
