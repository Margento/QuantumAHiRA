Preface.

Classical mechanics was first envisaged by Newton, formed into
a powerful tool by Euler, and brought to perfection by Lagrange and
Laplace, It-has served as the paradigm of science ever since. Even
the great revolutions of 19th century physics--namely, the Faraday-
Maxwell electro-magnetic theory and the kinetic theory-were viewed
as further support for the complete adequacy of the mechanistic world
view. The physicist at the end of the 19th century had a coherent
conceptual scheme which, in principle at least, answered all his
questions about the world. The only work left to be done was the
computing of the next decimal.

This consensus began to unravel at the beginning of the 20th
century. The work of Planck, Einstein, and Bohr simply could not be
made to fit. The series of ad hoc moves by Bohr, Eherenfest, et al,
now called the old quantum theory, was viewed by all as, at best, a
stopgap. In the period 1925-27 a new synthesis was formed by
Heisenberg, Schrodinger, Dirac and others. This new synthesis was
so successful that even today, fifty years later, physicists still
teach quantum mechanics as it was formulated by these men.

Nevertheless, two foundational tasks remained: that of providing
a rigorous mathematical formulation of the theory, and that of providing
a systematic comparison with classical mechanics so that the full
ramifications of the quantum revolution could be clearly revealed.
These tasks are, of course, related, and a possible fringe benefit

of the second task might be the pointing of the way "beyond quantum

--- Page 4 ---
theory". These tasks were taken up by von Neumann as a consequence
of a seminar on the foundations of quantum mechanics conducted by
Hilbert in the fall of 1926. In papers published in 1927 and in his
book, The Mathematical Foundations of Quantum Mechanics, von Neumann
provided the first completely rigorous treatment of quantum mechanics.
von Neumann first realized that the essential mathematical reason for
the equivalence of the matrix and wave mechanical formulations of
quantum mechanics was the isomorphism between the sequence space z"
and the function space i”; He was thus led to formulate the notion
of an abstract Hilbert space and to develope its mathematical
theory. The main motivation for the axioms for quantum mechanics
chosen by von Neumann in his book was that they yielded a rigorous
theory, notationally similar to and computationally as powerful as
that developed by the physicists. In his book he also alluded to a
deeper, more profound approach. He states on page 253:

As can be seen, the relation between the properties of

a physical system on the one hand, and the projections

on the other, makes possible a sort of logical calculus

with these. However, in contrast to the concepts of

ordinary logic, this system is extended by the concept

of "simultaneous decidability" which is characteristic

for quantum mechanics,
von Neumann and G. Birkhoff developed this approach in 1936 in a paper
entitled "The Logic of Quantum Mechanics", They introduced the notion
of the logic #2 of a physical theory. For classical theories 4 is a
Boolean algebra; but for quantum theories 2 is assumed to be isomorphic
to to the logic Proj(H) of projections in a complex separable Hilbert

space. In fact, it is now possible to derive von Neumann's original

formulation of quantum mechanics from the single axiom that # ~ Proj(H).

--- Page 5 ---
This program will be discussed in §3. Other assumptions on ¥ are
known to be appropriate in quantum statistical mechanics and in quantum
field theory and these will also be discussed in §3,

A natural question is: "What is the appropriate general abstract
structure for our logics, i.e. in what category do they live?" When
von Neumann and Birkhoff first considered this problem in the mid
1930's, the natural thing to do - given the mathematics of the time -
was to assume that # was a set on which the classical operations were
defined, but that they satisfied non-classical identities. This approach
leads one to assume that #~ is an ortho-complemented lattice, or an
ortho-complemented partially ordered set, or a partial Boolean algebra,
or some other related structure. This choice of syntax leads to certain
semantical viewpoints which have been explored by Finkelstein, Putnam,
Kochen and Specker, and others. Mathematically, our approach, which
will be based upon the concept of a diagram of Boolean algebras, may
be viewed as the natural change in perspective brought about by the
move from Birkhoff and Machane’s A Survey of Modern Algebra, to MacLane
and Birkhoff's Algebra. The natural semantics associated to our new
syntax seems to be identical to Bohr's philosophy of complementarity,
i.e. the world must be viewed through classical (Boolean) frames which
interlock in a non-trivial fashion. In §1 we will try to motivate this
choice of structure. In §1.3 we will provide a summary of the category
theory required for this work, §1 will also discuss a general formal
schema for science. Such a schema is necessary in order to understand
the formalism and how it is to be used. In §1 we will also discuss variou

questions relating to the nature of probability, the problem of

--- Page 6 ---
reductionism and the possibility of hidden variables theories; and the
possibility of "realistic" interpretations of the formalism, §2 will
discuss classical theories and §3 quantum theories.

This work is not meant to be a first introduction to the
foundations of quantum mechanics (for that see [38]), nor a
systematic treatise including the detailed development of the requisite
mathematics (for that see [81]), but, instead, a systematic
outline of a coherent approach to quantum mechanics with all the

assumptions carefully scrutinized for their physical meaning.

§1. A Formal Schema for Science.

In this section we shall develop a formal schema which is meant
to capture certain aspects of the scientific process. The relation-
ship between our schema and the actual scientific process should be
thought of as analogous to the relationship between the notion of a
formal mathematical system and the actual mathematical process.
Namely, we are neglecting human passions, social institutions and
many other complexities of the "real" world and focusing only on
certain central and formalizable aspects of the process. Our goal
is to provide a single schema which will encompass both classical
and quantum theories as special cases. This will provide a clear
comparison of the similarities and differences between these two
theories, while at the same time pointing the way "beyond" quantum

mechanics,

1.1, The Empirical Situation.

We will assume that each experiment that one is interested in
performing has a finite formal description E, and that performing E
yields a result in a finite set Rp: The experiments can be thought
of as being on a fixed "system" which may be in various internal
states @ € ,, depending upon how we prepared the system. The breakup
of the description of an experiment into the pair (a, E), consisting of
an initial "preparation" followed by an actual "observation", though
somewhat conventional, is very important for the development of our
formalism. On the other hand, the notion of the "system" itself is
often quite opaque and misleading. It plays a role similar to Kant's
-ding and sich . There is little trouble when one is talking about
billiard balls, tables, and the like, where one can simply "point" to
the system itself which one is trying to study. But how does one
"point" to an electron? Our experiments should really be thought of
as "modes of percieving", "ways of looking", and the results of our
experiments should be thought of as "what was seen", Careless use of
the notion of the "system itself" inevitably leads to the notorious
measurement problem which itself is reminiscent of the classical
problem of the relationship between phenomena and numina, In our
approach one deals strictly with phenomena and never even supposes the
existence of numina. Of course, by invoking Berkeley's universal
observer one can connect our approach with that of the traditional

realist position.

--- Page 9 ---
A picturesque way of thinking about our view of the empirical situa~-
tion is as follows. Assume we are given a large collection of black
boxes such that each box has a label @ € Lab = »& and various buttons
E,€ Exp. Below each button is a dial which may read a value in a
finite set Re; When a button is pressed,a result is recorded on the

dial and then the box blows up. Only one button can be pressed.

We will treat all boxes with the same label as identical. Hence, in
order to be able to "repeat" an experiment, it is necessary tp have
many boxes with the same label. Given the label ~, we would like to
be able to predict the result obtained when the experiment E is
performed. It is possible that knowledge of @ is insufficient to
predict the result of performing E. For example, if our experiment
consists of tossing a coin, we usually do not pack enough information
into our description of its state to determine a unique outcome. But
one is certainly free (in this case, at least) to believe that the
reason for this lack of determinism is purely practical, and not
fundamental, and that a fuller description of the states of the system
is possible (at least in principle), which would yield a deterministic
system. This belief leads to a research strategy of attempting to

find a more complete, more basic, more fundamental description of the

--- Page 10 ---
system. Whether such a reductionistic program is always possible
and/or useful is a perennial question which we will face many times
in this work. In any case, we will always assume that the state @
at least determines a unique probability distribution p(q@) on each
of the sets Ry This is a highly non-trivial assumption. It implies
that one has done a good job in describing the aspects of the system
under consideration which affect the results of the experiments to
be performed. For example, if we have two types of weighted coins,
one type of which always comes up heads and the other always comes
up tails, andifwe cannot distinguish the types of coins, then it is
possible that in tossing a large collection of such coins ho

stable frequency distributions will be discovered.

To each set R, we associate its power set a(R,) (= the set of all
subsets of Ry) and think of #(Rp) as the Boolean algebra of questions
associated to the experiment E. That is, eachQc Ry is to be thought
of as the question: When E was performed, was the result in Q? The
diagram (see §1.3) of sets 2 = {Ry} will be called the surface con-
figuration space of our system. The associated diagram of Boolean
algebras = {@(R,) } will be called the surface logic of our system.
Our basic assumption so far is the existence of a map p:Lab 7 Prob(e ),
from the set of labels to the set of probability measures on “

(see §1.3). The set Lab can always be assumed to have a natural convex
structure as follows. If Qys+++)Q@, are labels and Pys+++s Py, are weights
such that Ps 20 and ; = 1, then choose a large natural number N and

form a new ensemble of N boxes with label @ by choosing for each i, p,N

--- Page 11 ---
10

boxes with label a and stamping the new label a over the old label
a+ Knowledge of the label a is certainly not maximal knowledge of
our systema is called a classical mixture of the states Oe; with
weights Py The map p:Lab ~ Prob (2°) is easily seen to be a convexity—
preserving morphism from the above described convex structure on
Lab to the natural convex structure on Prob(¢*). But, while a
label which is a classical mixture certainly represents ignorance,
there is no a priori reason to attribute any ignorance to a label
a@ whose associated probability measure Py on £ is not pure! The
deterministic research program, if successful, will redescribe all
our present labels which do not go to pure probability measures as
classical mixtures of a new set of pure labels all of which do
determine pure probability measures. But, until such a program is
successfully carried out, we will assume that the process may be
"intrinsically stochastic". This seems to be the most reasonable
and commonsensical attitude towards a coin toss, for example.

How does one determine p? One way, of course, is to do lots of
experiments. This direct approach can only yield an estimate of p,
may be very expensive, and, in any case, is usually not very
enlightening. What one really needs at this point is a good theory.
The theoretical situation will be discussed in the next section.

There are some people who just can't resist trying to look
inside a black box. They will insist on trying to open the box with
a screw driver, or, at least, look into the box with an x-ray machine.

From our point of view, what they are doing is, in effect, putting

--- Page 12 ---
11

the original black box into a larger black box which contains more
buttons, i.e. they are insisting on usingalarger repertoire of modes
of percieving. Sometimes such a viewpoint is useful, sometimes not.
Why not simply allow all possible modes of perceiving? The reason
is simple. It has to do with the chances of developing a good theory.
The world as a whole is a mess! Only by narrowing our sights and
focusing in on a small part of the universe can we have any reasonable
hope of attaining a deep understanding. This has been the method of
science, and it has proved very successful in practice, Thus, we
have Skinner's program for understanding animal behavior and developing
an art of behavioral engineering without invoking scalpels, electrodes
or modern chemistry. Similarly,in physics it is (usually) inappro-
priate to look into the experimenters sex life. Both the use of a
scalpel and a view of the experimenters sex life may be very revealing.
But they are both banned from the allowed techniques of the above
sciences, Other sciences do allow the scapel and/or a view of the
experimenter's sex life, namely, neurophysiology and Freudian
psychology. Thus, the basic method is , first,to focus in on a few
basic modes of perceiving and to develop a good theory and deep
insight into this restricted domain of discourse; and then later to
attempt to expand one's repertoire and broaden the domain of discourse.
One might also wonder how it is possible to develop good theories
of what we see before we have reasonable theories of how we see. In
other words, how can we use instruments without knowing how they work?

Of course, the fact is that we do so all the time! Man has seen the

--- Page 13 ---
12

world with his eyes and formed many successful theories about the
world long before he understood how his eyes worked. (For that matter,
do we even today understand how the eyes work or what light is?)
In fact, one needs a good theory about what was supposed to have been
seen before one can say that an instrument malfunctioned. A good
example of this is the fact that only fairly recently has the
existence and prevalence of color blindness been discovered. Only
by having an external standard of what he should have seen can a
person who is color blind actually realize it. Another good example
is that Newtonian celestial mechanics was successfully developed
using telescopes (or at least the eye) as the basic observing instru-
ment before it was known that light had a finite velocity of propagation;
it was, in fact, a disagreement between what Newtonian mechanics said
should be seen and what was actually seen that led to the first reason-
ably accurate estimate of the velocity of light. Of course, pointing
a familiar instrument in a new direction will usually yield new
perspectives which are rapidly assimilatable. Thus, once we feel that
we understand how a microscope works, very rapid progress can be made
by simply looking at everything under the microscope. This has been
the case for light and electron microscopes and probably will be the
case for quark microscopes, if they are ever made. Having a theory
of how an instrument works clearly involves looking at the instrument
with other - presumably more familiar - instruments.

Now, it may happen that we discover, through a lot of experimenting,

that the map p:Lab - Prob(Z°) is not surjective. We may believe this to

--- Page 14 ---
13

be due to our lack of technical knowhow in providing for a sufficiently
diverse range of preparations,i.e. if we were cleverer, we could
enlarge the set Lab and thus obtain a surjective map. This attitude
leads to a research strategy of attempting to enlarge Lab. If this
strategy fails in significantly enlarging the image of p, then we

might change our attitude towards this failure of surjectivity from
that of being our fault to that of being "natures" fault, i.e. we

may decide to attribute the lack of surjectivity of p to a "law of
nature", Thus, that objects when released fall and that the light

goes on when the switch is flicked, would not simply be viewed as
summaries of high correlation coefficients, but as something more
significant. Thus, when it was discovered that parity was not always
conserved, this was not simply viewed as a minor correction in
estimated correlation coefficients, but as a major change in per-
spective and of how we expect the world to work. Physicists were
surprised by Nature's violation of parity. After the discovered
violation of parity, physicists then also expected and later discovered
violations of C and T invariance. But most of them do not expect
violation of CPT invariance. This is because CPT invariance is a
theorem of a very general axiomatization of quantum field theory and
its violation would require a drastic revision of the physicists’
conception of nature. Only time will tell whether such a revision will,
in fact, be necessary. But, in any case, a position has been taken
which is certainly not simply a summary of past correlation coefficients.
What we have been implicitly criticizing is Hume's attitude towards

causality. With Hume's attitude one would never be surprised by any

--- Page 15 ---
14

occurence. If the sun didn't rise tomorrow, one would simply and
calmly revise one's estimate of the probability of the sun's rising
on the next day. Such an attitude certainly does not describe the
way people often behave. Positions have to be taken and theories
have to be developed even though they open us up to the possibility
of being surprised!

If the map p:Lab - Prob(£>) is not injective one often describes
the situation by saying that many superficially distinct ways of
preparing the system actually put it into the same internal state.

We will have more to say about this in the next section.

Summarizing, we have in this section introduced a formalization
of the experimental process which includes: a set Lab of recipes for
preparing the "system" under consideration; a surface logic Z° of
experimental questions; and a priori map p:Lab ~ Prob(é). So far,
the only way discussed of determining p is to do lots of experiments.
This formalization is not too far removed from the description of his
work that an experimentalist would give in a publication. Of course,
the experimentalist would usually consider the most creative part of
his work to be the process whereby he decides what to measure, how to
measure it, and how to display the results. The actual carrying out
of the experiment and the ensuing paperwork he may very well leave to
his lab assistants. We have no idea how to formalize this very compli-
cated decision process.(such a task might be as difficult as writing
the program for HAL 9000). Luckily, it won't be necessary for our
program of understanding the similarities and differences between

classical and quantum mechanics. These differences reside, from our

--- Page 16 ---
15

point of view, entirely in the structure of the deep logic, er. to
be introduced shortly.

It has been suggested that our formalism leads to a picture of
the world as a huge room filled with buttons and dials. This is
certainly a bleak and colorless world view! But, by simply deciding
to have the output of our instruments presented in the form of color
photographs or put on cathode ray screens with accompanying sound

tracks, we obtain a much more vivid and colorful world view.

1.2. The Theoretical Situation.

In this section we will introduce the notion of the deep con-
figuration space, ef, and the deep logic, Z#, of a system. (While we
have already warned the reader in §1.1 of the dangers of the use
of the notion of the "system", we find it linguistically necessary
to keep invoking it in order to convey our ideas without inordinate
circumlocutions.) Consider the problem of measuring the length of a
rod. There are many different ways to measure the length of a rod,
and, on the empirical level, they are all a priori independent, and
thus determine disjoint sub-algebras of Ze TH fact, on the empirical
level, we cannot really talk about the length of a rod, but only about the
value obtained by some length=measuring operation. The notion of the
length of a rod is a theoretical concept, where all the various ways of
measuring the length are conjoined into a single concept. In mathematical
terms, we have a homomorphism p:= et from our surface logic z to a
deep logic zo which describes the "true" nature of the system. The actual
situation is even more complicated, since the various instruments are
usually viewed as not to be actually recording the value of the true lengt
but instead to be outputting a message which, besides containing the true
signal, also contains noise. Thus, the empirical instruments are viewed
as "noisy observables" from whose output wm@canoniy probabilistically infer
the true value, i.e. one must attempt to filter out the noise in order to
obtain the true signal. The reader may detect an echo of Plato's view
that the senses reveal only a"corrupted copy" of the "true". Note

that once we have introduced our deep logic and its associated

--- Page 18 ---
17

notion of what our instruments were supposed to have recorded, we
can begin to talk about how well our instruments are working and how
noisy they are. If » is not 1-1, then our theory tells us that
certain observables, which on the empirical level are a priori
different, are, in "reality" measuring the same thing. In terms
of our box model, two different buttons (or, at least, certain parts
of their outputs) are equivalent. One way this might happen is if
we had a box in which more than one button could be pressed at the
same time. Pressing E,or pressing both Ej and Eo but recording only
the dial reading of E, are a priori completely different experiments,
and, in fact, it is easy to design boxes where they are totally
unrelated. But we may have reason to believe that the two experiments
are really measuring the same thing (for example, if the box comes
in two halves with no visible connections). Thus, choosing a » which
is not 1-1 is a way of identifying certain empirical observables.

If » is not onto, and we really believe in the correctness of
24, then we are led to re-examine the empirical situation in order to
discover means of experimentally measuring the qualities of the system
which our theory, Zt, says it has. If successful, this would yield a
richer surface log Z and an extended homomorphism ez - ~4 such
that © is onto. In fact, it is even reasonable to look for a @ which
is surjective on Boolean subalgebras, i.e. if Ayy +++ € zo are compatible,
that is, are contained in a Boolean subalgebra of Zz. then there should
exist experimentally compatible A_,... € Z* such that rr) (3,) = A,;- In
more informal terms, if {A,} are theoretically compatible, then they

are Simultaneously observable. For example, suppose our experiments

--- Page 19 ---
18
consist of taking single photographs of a cup from various possible
angles. Our experiments yield only the two dimensional projections
of the actual cup in three space, i.e, we really believe in a deep
logic consisting of the Borel algebra of the configuration space of
closed subsets of R°, while our surface logic is a disjoint collection
of logics each of which is isomorphic to the Borel algebra of the .
configuration space of closed subsets of R?. In this case, we can
use holograms to extend the surface logic to one that will be sur-
jective. On the other hand, if we are attempting to model the sun
and wish to include in our model the "atoms at the center of the sun",
then these "atoms" will appear in our deep logic, but certainly won't
(at least at present) appear anywhere in our surface logic. © An even
more extreme example occurs when one wishes to discuss atoms in a star
10" light years away. According to present theory (special relativity),
we will never be able to lift these theoretical observables up from
the "twilight zone" of the deep logic to the "real world" of our surface
logic! We thus realize that there will be many situations where we
will be interested in a deep logic which is not entirely covered by
a surface logic. One thus talks about theoretical or "potential"
observables in contrast to the actual empirical (noisy) observables.
Kant, atee, had found it necessary to introduce the notion of "potential
phenomena". We are thus led to a form of platonic dualism consisting
of an ideal world of theoretical observables in contrast to an empirical
world of corrupted observables. The map oo: ae # induces a map on
probability measures o* :Prob (2%)-Prov(é*) and, in order to be able to

use ry for making predictions, it is necessary to assume that we are

--- Page 20 ---
19

also given a map p, :Lab aad Prob (2°) such that the diagram

Lab ——2_—_» prop(z*)

‘ t

Prob (£°)

commutes. Once we have committed ourselves to a particular choice of

Po no amount of experimental observations can force us to relinquish

it! One can always invoke more "noise" in our instruments to explain
away a seeming lack.of commutativity in diagram (1.2.1). If the noise
level gets very high, then the intensity of our commitment to this
particular logic tends to decrease. We may then refer to it as a
"model'', which may be "good", possibly only "approximate", maybe only
"heuristic". We may even go so far as to suspect that a different

choice of za would be "better", To talk about a logic 2 as a model

for some physical phenomena means that when we investigate the properties
of 2 we find them to behave in an analogous fashion to certain physical
phenomena. Recall the physicists use of such models as the harmonic
oscillator, the ising model, and the P(@) 5 quantum field theory model.
The first two models are usually called "approximate" ; the third

model isn't actually thought to correspond to any physically real system
since we currently believe space-time to be four- and not two-dimensional,
Yet all three models are thought to provide insight into the true
workings of the world. What exactly is the relationship between the
theoretician's computation of the spectrum of a certain Hermitian

operator and the experimentalist's burning of hydrogen and measuring

--- Page 21 ---
20

the spectrum of the emitted light? Certainly, one usually describes
the situation by invoking "informal" correspondence rules which, if
formalized, would yield diagram (1.2.1). But we suspect that most--
if not all-- serious uses of theories involve the tying together of
theory and experiment through the use of a vague appeal to analogy:
Behold! the World and the Model behave similarly. We would like to
know the "true" deep logic , but will settle for "model" logics
which yield insight. In any case, we feel that the diagram (1.2.1)
is crucial for understanding the formalism of quantum mechanics,

The factoring of p through Prob (£°) may allow us to "explain"
why p is not surjective; namely, it isn't because Pe isn't. On
the other hand, we would still want to understand why Py isn't sur-
jective . For example, a relativistic model would not contain a
probability measure corresponding to a preparation of a billiard
ball with a velocity 101° miles per second. Hence, any failyre on
our part to prepare such a system is looked upon as a success of the
theory and not as a failure of our ingenuity. On the other hand, the
model may contain a probability measure corresponding to a preparation
of the billiard ball at a location yw light years away. We don't
know how to prepare such a system. But, by viewing ourselves as part
of a larger relativistic model, we understand our failure as, again,
not due to a lack of ingemuity on our part. We thus require any
failure of Py to be surjective to be "explained". Failure of p to
be surjective should be explained by the lack of surjectivity of e

The deterministic research program described in §1.1 suffers a

huge setback with the requirement that the map p:Lab - Prob(é) factor

--- Page 22 ---
21

through the map @* pronGe ~ Prob(g*). This is because Pe may have
no pure probability measures in its image. This is, in fact, the Situation
for the standard quantum logic 2 = Proj(H). The usual move adopted
by physicists is to assume a basic collection of labels Lab, which
represent maximal knowledge of individual boxes and which go via Py
to extreme probability messures on £7, 11 other labels are to be
deacribed as classical mixtures of these basic labels. But is it fair
to be prejudiced against a fair coin? We prefer not to require the
image of Lab, under Py to consist of extreme probability measures.
Thus, we may want to represent the state of a quantum system by a
von Neumann density matrix and yet still claim no ignorance on our
part! Similarly, we may want to describe a single sample of a "classical"
gas by a probability measure on phase space. By assuming that the
dynamics is governed by a Markov process instead of a Hamiltonian
system, one may readily explain the macroscopic phenomena without having
to invoke either ensembles or ergodic theorems (see §2). (This example
really shows that what we are calling "classical mechanics" is really
"quantum mechanics with a Boolean depth logic"!)

With this attitude, one not only doesn't expect Py to be injective
on Lab, but one isn't even sure that it is reasonable to seek for a
Lab, on which it is injective. There may be many labels which go to
the same probability measure on eZ, but none of which can be physically
described as classical mixtures of more basic labels. In any case,
ignorance should only be ascribed to those labelS which can be
"redescribed" as classical mixtures. Ignorance should never be ascribed

to probability measures on the deep logic. Yet, if one has done ones

--- Page 23 ---
22

work well, then it would seem reasonable to say of two labels

a, BE Lab,, Such that P, (a) = P, (8); that they yield the same "state"
of the individual boxes. Not to say so could only be justified by the
belief in the existence of a larger theory containing more observables
where q@ and 8 would be seen to be empirically different. So long as
our belief in a particular zt is firm, we will accept the equality

P, (a) = p, (8) as any "explanation" for the empirical observation that
pla) = p@).

It may happen that several different theories yield reasonably
accurate results. Then the decision between them may be based upon
various non-scientific criteria-- historical, religious, personal,
aesthetic, etc. One also often takes into account the pragmatic
criteria of ease, speed, and cost of computation. It is these
pragmatic criteria which induce astronomers to continue to use Newtonian
mechanics instead of the much prettier general relativity of Einstein
for orbital computations.

Given a theory Ty: one may seek to "reduce" it to a more basic,
more fundamental, more expressive theory To. By a "reduction" we mean

to imply that T, is not found to be incorrect, only shallow. Thus,

1
a reduction should include a redescription of the labels in Ty as
classical mixtures of labels in To, i.e. a map Lab, - Labo, and a

redescription of the observables in Ty as observables in To, i.e. a

map a > Ps . One, of course, also requires that the diagram

Prob (£4) < nob (24)


--- Page 24 ---
23

commutes. Thus, instead of seeing two competing theories, the
reduction lets us see two compatible theories—- the latter being the
more profound one. Of course, this last value judgment would
become confused if it were possible both to reduce Ty to To and also
to reduce To to T,! In practice, reductions as defined above rarely
occur since one of the main motivations of a reductionist is to
obtain a more accurate~- "truer''-- theory. Thus, he will not expect
diagram (1 2.2) to strictly commute. In other, more extreme situations,
he will really be obtaining a totally different description of the
world, and there might be virtually no basis for comparison of the
theories-- neither on the depth level nor on the surface level. The
two theories would really be about two entirely different types of
boxes, i.e. two different worlds or realms of discourse.

We can now begin to understand how it is possible to simultaneously
have proofs that quantum mechanics admits of no hidden variables
theories, while at the same time to have proofs that hidden variables
theories always exist. The second proof is by far the simpler. Its

essence is to simply observe that, given the situation

one can always factor it into

The essence of this move is the "unpacking" of the original deep logic,
i.e. we, in effect, say that Ph identified to many surface observables
which are really different. Thus, this move does not really yield a
reduction, but, instead, a competitor. Our construction is, of course,
too ad hoc to be mistaken for a "serious" competitor. But more

specialized, less ad hoc models can always be found which will bear

--- Page 26 ---
25

a similar relationship to the original theory. This is the situation
with the hidden variables models constructed by Bohm, Nelson and

others. These theories are not really quantum theories, but, instead,
competitor theories attempting - somewhat successfully - to redescribe
the surface phenomena. We do not expect any of the present competitors
of quantum theory to supplant it, but tolerance should be practiced .
since these alternatives often shed great light on the standard quantum
mechanical description of phenomena, make us think more deeply, and

may even suggest interesting experiments. In truth, the real motivation
behind most.hidden variables theorists is, not a love of Boolean logic,
but, instead, the desire for a "realist" world view. They want to know
how the "world" really works, not how it appears to work. In.
Einstein's words: "In the final analysis, the world only happens once",
The realist would not care for our whole mode of discourse. His ideal
would be a theory such as general relativity (interpreted realistically,
of course). Putnam and, later, Bub have tried to interpret the quantum
logic "realistically" aS implying a revolution in "logic". This may
be possible, but we don't feel that they have done the work necessary
to make adequate sense of and to evaluate their suggestion. (For
example, would one have to develop a quantum set theory?)

The fact that quantum mechanics doesn't admit a strict Boolean
reduction follows from a deep theorem of Gleason (see §3). Gleason's
theorem implies that the standard quantum logic, Proj(H), admits no
homomorphisms into any Boolean algebra. Similarly, Greechie has shown
that one can construct logics which admit of no homomorphisms into

either Boolean or (standard) quantum logics.

--- Page 27 ---
26

In order to obtain a more concrete understanding of what these
theorems say, we shall now consider their implications for our "box"
model of the scientific process. The theorem that hidden variables
theories always exist implies that no matter how the boxes behave on
the surface level, we can always fill in the boxes with Boolean
devices so as to capture the same ensemble behavior, i.e. we can
always design alternative boxes out of gears, circuits, and other
classical Boolean devices, so that the external, surface behavior
of our designed boxes is identical with that of "natures" boxes.

Thus, a Kelvin-Tait type program is always possible although one may doubt
its usefullness. (heir original program for Maxwell's theory eventually
‘fell into disrepute.) Hertz’s: statement that "Maxwell's theory is

about Maxwell's theory" implied that one should consider one’s tool

box as containing more than just gears, i.e. electro-magnetic

phenomena should be considered basic phenomena not ‘requiring

further explanation. In fact, today one-is often

more likely to attempt to explain the behavior of gears by invoking
electro-magnetic phenomena than vice versa. If more than one button

can be pressed at one time, then the Boolean move might require us to
consider the pressing of several buttons simultaneously unrelated

to the pressing of them individually, i.e. we might have a contextualistic
theory. Thus, even if our wxeS come in two haives, with one half on

the moon and the other half on the earth, and they have no visible
connections, we might still have to say that the results obtained by
pressing a button on the part of the box on the earth may depend upon

what buttons are simultaneously pressed on the moon. These "non-locai”
possibilities have been stressed by Bell. They require us to have "non-loca

--- Page 28 ---
27
Boolean devices if we want to build such boxes. Classical theory
had plenty of non-local devices, e.g. the gravitational field, but
these non-local objects were always viewed suspiciously by classical
scientists. For example, Newton felt that anyone who really believed
in action at a distance was not philosophically minded. Presumably,
Einstein felt similarly. Bell has remarked that he had resolved the
E-P-R paradox in a way that Einstein would have liked least. Thus,
a high price might have to be paid in order to allow for a Boolean
depth logic; for a realist, the price seems to be worth paying.

If one has a theory Pig ais ee, and one requires that in the
design of our artificial boxes we must make two buttons that © says
are the same actually be the same (i.e. pressing either button yields
the same result, not just the same statistics), then Gleason's theorem
tells us that we cannot design such a box for a quantum mechanical
system out of Boolean devices. We can, of course, design such a box
using quantum mechanical devices such as lasers, electron beams, etc.
If Greechie logics actually occurred,then one would need an even larger
tool box of devices, since a Greechie box could not be built out of
quantum mechanical devices.

In the aftermath of the downfall of the Kelvin-Tait program, one
runs the risk of having to have a very heavy tool box of "fundamental

devices". One tries to steer a course between viewing all devices as

fundamental and viewing no device as fundamental.

Ls Category Theory.

One of the main motivations for introducing the depth logic is
that it is a way of identifying two surface observables, or, at least,
parts of their outputs. A contemporary mathematician, attempting to
formalize this idea, will naturally be led to the concept of a "diagram"
of Boolean algebras. Furthermore, this assumption on the structure
of z is the weakest one still adequate to obtain all the results
of quantum theory. In this section we will provide a short review of
category theory. (See [50] or [51 | for a systematic introduction to
category theory >)

A category @ consists of objects X,Y,... € Ob(@) and morphisms
£,g,... € Mor(@). Every morphism f has a domain and a range, dom(f),
range(f) € Ob(@). If the range of f is equal to the domain of g, then
f and g can be composed to yield a morphism h = gef from dom(f) to
range(g), Composition is associative and every object X has a unique
identity morphism 1, from it to itself which is an identity for the
operation of composition, (Actually, one can follow Lawvere. [43 ] and
give an axiomatization of category theory which is independent of set
theory, and then use category theory as a new foundation for mathematics.)
Typical examples of categories are the category of sets and set
mappings; the category 4 of groups and group homomorphism; and the
category J of topological spaces and continuous mappings.

Given two categories Cy and Co, a functor F from Cz to Co is a
pair of mappings F' :0b(¢,) Sd Ob (Cy) and F" :Mor (¢,) = Mor (Co), such that

the category structure is preserved, i.e. domains, ranges, identity

mappings, and composition. Typical examples of functors are the
"forgetful" functors N from ¥ or J to »# which associate to every group
or topological space its underlying set and to every homomorphism or
continuous map its underlying set mapping. Given two functors
Fidy ~” Co and Glo 2 Cz) one can form a composite functor
H = GeF:01 + Cz 3 one thus obtains the category, Cat, of categories
and functors.

Given two functors F,G:0, ” Co: a natural transformation7 :F - G
is a map 7 :0b(C,) > Mor (Co) such that for every X € Ob(C,},

n(X):F'(X) - G'(X), and if X aac Y, then the diagram

F(x) 20) @r¢x)

F"(£) G"(f)

Fi(y) 2&2, @r(y)

commutes. The construction which associates to a set the free group

generated by that set determines a functor F:/ ~- g. The natural
inclusion of a set X into (the underlying set of) the free group
generated by X determines a natural transformation 7:1, NeG. Similarly,
one has a natural transformation y:FeN ~ 1,. One can also show that

P
there is a natural bijection

(1.3.1) #(X,NG) = #(FX,G) ,

where @(X,Y) is the set of morphisms in @ from X to Y. Under these

circumstances, one says that N and F are adjoint functors (the name

--- Page 31 ---
30

coming from the formal similarity of (1.3.1) with the formula defining
adjoint linear operators on Hilbert space). The forgetful functor
N:7 - # also has an adjoint (in fact, both a left and a right adjoint).
Given two categories C1 and Co: we can form the functor category
ont whose objects are functors from Cy to Co and whose morphisms are
natural transformations of functors. Given a category @, there is a
natural associated "opposite" category, ger. obtained from @ by reversing
all the arrows, i.e. Ob(¢°P) = ob(@) and c°? (x,y) = c(¥,X). A functor
Fs0q” “Co is said to be a contravariant functor from Cy to Co:
lfGcisa category, then a diagram over @ is a functor X:I -¢.
We will usually use the notation (x, } to denote the diagram X, where
xy = X(q@) for @ € Ob(I), the bonding morphisms being suppressed in the
notation. If {X,} is a diagram over @, then the direct limit
lim e(-,X)) defines a contravariant functor from @ to », i.e. an object
of f°. Hence, one can form a category ginj - @, whose objects are
diagrams over @ and whose morphisms from {X,} to {¥,} are natural
transformations from lim (-,%)) to lim (-,¥,)- ginj-c is a full-
subcategory of Pad '
We will now give a direct way of representing the morphisms of
ginj-c. Let {xX }y and {Y¥g}y be diagrams over ©. Suppose given for each
a € Ob(I) a B(a) € Ob(J) and a morphism £3 (a) XK, 7 Xg(q) 12 © such that

f:lim e(-,X,) = lim C(-1¥Q) ,

and, hence, a morphism f in ginj-? from X to Y. Every morphism in
ginj-c is so representable and it is even possible to define an equi-
valence relation on such representatives so as to give a direct
definition of ginj-@ without thinking of it as a full sub-category of
#". This alternative definition is quite useful, e.g. it shows
immediately that any functor FC, > Co extends to a functor

F:ginj-C, - ginjp- @ sg full sub-category of ginj-@ and the natural
full embedding ginj-< - F admits an adjoint. Given a diagram {x}

we can also form the functor lim CK -) and thus obtain a full sub-

category gpro-< of Fi The morphisms of gpro-@ also admit a direct

definition. These categories are natural generalizations of the categorie

inj-@ and pro-@ introduced by Grothendieck [31 |]. We realize that
the above brief discussion will not be very enlightening to most
readers; our only excuse for not giving a longer, more leisurely
discussion is that we were skeptical that it would be any more
enlightening to the reader not already initiated into the mysteries
of category theory.

In §1.1 we associated to each empirical observable E its finite
set Rp of possible results and the associated finite Boolean algebra
of "questions" 9(R,)- We also assumed that each state (i.e. label) a
determined a probability measure on @(R,) - Since everything was finite,
there were no technical complications.. But, when one moves to the
theoretical situation, one is often (in fact, almost always) motivated
to allow the deep configuration space af to be an infinite topological
space (e.g., the real numbers R) and to take for ones deep logic Pa
the Borel g-algebra of 4, a(c3) (e.g., the Borel g-algebra of R), and
to consider g-additive probability measures on é (e.g., Gaussian
measure on @(R)). An historical example of this move is the relation-
ship between the binomial and normal distributions. The normal dis-
tribution was originally viewed as simply a curve fit to the binomial
distribution; only later was it viewed as defining its own real-valued
random variable. Real-valued random variables are conceptually much
more complicated than discrete-valued random variables though, as in
the case of the normal distribution vis a vis the binomial distribution,
often much simpler from a computational viewpoint. Thus, we will

follow tradition and take as our basic (classical) logical category,

--- Page 34 ---
33

the category @ of Boolean g-algebras and g-homomorphisms. Probability
measures will be understood to be countably additive. Usually our
logics will arise as the Borel algebras of nice topological spaces.

The general (non-classical) logical category we will use will be
ginj-6, i.e., the category whose objects are diagrams of Boolean
g-algebras. If £= {BL} is a logic, then a probability measure p

on # is a family {Py} of probability measures on the By such that if

£5 7B, - B, is a bond in 2, then p, = Pg*tg: The convex set of all such
probability measures on £ will be denoted Prob(Z). It is easy to check
that a homomorphism #4 - £' in ginj-B induces a convexity preserving map
Prob(v') - Prob(Z). A homomorphism # - 2’ will.also be called an
~-valued random variable on ~'. A map {Prob(B)) } - (Prob(B,) } in
gpro-Ge/, where @/ is the category of convex sets and convexity-preserving
maps, Will be called a noisy homomorphism or a noisy £-valued random
variable on #',and it will be denoted by £---->2'. Since

Prob(Z) = lim{Prob(B )}, a noisy homomorphism #% ----> #~' also induces

a map Prob(g') ~- Prob(¥). For £ = @(R), such homomorphisms will be
called (noisy) real-valued random variables. (One could even motivate
going so far as to change one’s basic category from @ to the category

of Boolean algebras and noisy homomorphisms Addition and multiplication
on R induce on the set ginj @(@(R),#) the structure of a partial com-
mutative algebra over R (i.e. operations are only sometimes defined,
but when they are, everything is classical (commutative)). This
partial algebra is also equal to lim 8((R) 8)» where the direct limit
is taken in the category of partial algebras. From this viewpoint, the

move from a classical to a quantum mechanical system is not a move from

--- Page 35 ---
34

a commutative to a non-commutative algebra @ of real-valued observables,
but, instead, a move from a commutative algebra to a partial commutative
algebra of observables. Of course, every non-commutative algebra
determines an underlying partial commutative algebra and also its
diagram of commutative subalgebras. The fact that assuming the
structure of a non-commutative algebra is the wrong assumption has
already been observed in the literature (see, for example, [19]),
but it is often replaced by another wrong assumption, namely that of
assuming the structure of a Jordan algebra. These differing assumptions
on the structure of @ affect the size of its automorphism group and),
hence, of the allowable symmetries of the system (the weaker the assumed
structure on @, the larger is its automorphism group). In §3 we will
discuss these issues more fully.

The contravariant functor @ which associates to every topological
space X its g-algebra of Borel subsets extends to a functor
@:gpro-7 - ginj-@. Thus, if we start by assuming the existence of a
deep configuration space af = {e,3 € gpro-7 together with a (measurable)
morphism ef at ce, application of @ yields a deep logic zt 2 ro
together with a morphism £ 2 om ae aot = Zé, One advantage of
starting with ef is that using it one can define the partial algebra
of continuous real~valued observables a, and not just the partial algebra
of measurable observables an° When one notes that all classical systems
with manifold phase spaces have isomorphic algebras of measurable
observables, but non-isomorphic algebras of continuous observables, one
sees that a captures a lot more of the physics of a classical system

than does Bry* Thus, I. E. Segal's approach to quantum mencanics via

assuming that ae is isomorphic to the partial algebra of Hermitian
elements in a c* -algebra, besides being a much simpler assumption than
would be required on ay? is also a physically much richer assumption,

since many non-isomorphic q@,'s correspond to isomorphic an S+

1.4 Symmetry Principles.

It should be reasonably clear to the reader that much stronger
assumptions will have to be made before the formalism described in
§1.3 can be made to yield interesting results. Symmetry principles
are among the most powerful and beautiful ways of recovering the
standard results of both classical and quantum mechanics. In this
section we will introduce and try to motivate certain general symmetry
assumptions. These ideas will then be further pursued in §§2 and 3.

Consider the situation pictured below:

Xx
pS SS sD ee

a

OG ot dy et Uf i .

(14.1)

--- Page 38 ---
. S7

We have a preparing device (PD) capable of being placed in various
positions a € R and of being ‘set at various settings B € B; thus,
our set of basic labels is just Lab, = R x B. We also have an array
of detectors (D) placed at various positions x € R; thus, for instance,
our surface logic might be @(R). R acts naturally on Lab and we may
want to assume that besides this surface action on Lab, there is also
a deep action of Ron Prob (2°) such that the natural map

p, ‘Lab - Prob(2%) is equivariant. This is a strong asséaSeion! Of
course, there is nothing sacred in the above about the group R--any
group G may be appropriate; for example, the Euclidean group, the
Galilean group, and the Lorentz group are often used.

In the situation pictured in (1.4.1) it will often te discovered
that translating the preparing device by y € R has the same effect as
translating the array of detectors by -y. This type of observation
often leads one to even assume that the symmetry group G also acts on
2° in such a way that the natural map g:<° ~ 2° is equivalent and the
induced action on Prob (é°) is just the original action.

The group occurring most frequently is the time translation group
T= Ri. Consider loaded coins whose probability of heads is a(t) = qtt
mod 1, where q € [0,1]. T is certainly acting nicely on the set
{(a,t)} = Lab, but unless we pack a great deal into 24, it won't act
in a compatible convexity-preserving way on prob(g°). This is because
many different classical mixtures of these coins have the same ensemble
statistics if our only allowable experiments are a single coin toss.

In fact, by considering weighted perishable coins (after one toss they
disappear), one is led to introduce a set »&/ of theoretical states and

mappings Lab, Sa Aled Prob (2). Group actions may only extend from Lab,

--- Page 39 ---
oY

to » and not all the way to Prob (2°). This example should be kept

in mind to remind the reader of the strength of the assumption that

G acts on Prob(£°) or even on a itself. In the case of "irreversible"
systems, one can only assume that the semi-group tt = Rt acts on
Prob(¢%). If one starts with a basic map Lab, ~ Prob(£%), then even

if the action of G extends from Lab, to Prob (£9) there is no a priori
reason to assume that the action of Gon Prob (£9) is convexity
preserving.

If we go all the way and assume that G acts on Z£, then, of course,
it also acts by convexity~preserving automorphisms on Prob (2°). These
subtle distinctions will soon be very impdértant.

We've already mentioned in §1.1,that the breakup of the description
of an experiment into the two parts (q@,E) has a conventional aspect.

In our discussion of time, above, we've taken a "Schrodinger" viewpoint
and had the time group act directly on the states. An alternative
approach is to assume that time acts directly on ones observables.

If z£ is the surface logic of the Schrodinger approach, then oles
will be the surface logic in the Heisenberg approach, i.e. one copy

of 2 for each time t € T. A Similar move can be made for other groups
and semi-groups. Thus, if a Schrodinger approach used a deep logic

i, then the Heisenberg approach might use a deep logic (2). T acts
in a compatible way on te} and tz), and, hence, induces a convexity-
preserving action on Prob( {£¢}). At this point, there is no real
difference between these two approaches, But the Heisenberg approach

suggests using a more interesting deep logic a which contains (ee.

Then the two approaches become distinct?

--- Page 40 ---
37

Consider, for example, the case of a"particle". In this case it
is reasonable to start from a basic position observable which yields
a result in R° and to assume that our system is invariant under the
full Euclidean group é3- Thus, we are looking for systems of imprimi-
tivity for (e(R*) ,83) in a deep logic “. We may now add time to our
picture by assuming that T acts on Prob(2%) (Schrodinger picture), or
by assuming that we are actually looking for a system of imprimitivity
for ({e(R®) 3, 85 x T) (Heisenberg picture). In fact, one should go
further and replace the Newtonian space-time group $3 x T by either
the Galilean or Lorentz group. Two other possibilities also occur as
one contemplates the space-time point of view: namely, a theory of
"events" and a theory of "trajectories". For a theory of events one
should look for systems of imprimitivity for (e(R*),¢), where G is an
appropriate space-time group acting on Rr? (e.g., the Lorentz group).
For a theory of trajectories one might look for systems of imprimitivity
for (g(L),G), where L is the 6-dimensional homogeneous space of time~—
like lines ink* and G is the (inhomogeneous) Lorentz group. One can,
of course, go even further and consider more complex hyperspaces of
subsets of nga Also, one can consider diagrams of logics {24} indexed
by subsets of n*, Such objects are needed in field theory and the
statistical mechanics of infinite systems. These ideas will be further

pursued in §§2 and 3.

§2. Classical Theories ,

In this section we shall discuss various systems whose depth
logic # is either Boolean or a disjoint union of Boolean logics.
Ps will be obtained here as the logic associated to a deep con-

figuration space a.
§2.1. Statics

The simplest non-trivial example is where ef = Zo = {0,1}. Zo
might be the appropriate configuration space for describing a coin
tossing experiment. A probability measure y on Zo is canpletely
determined by its value on 0, y(O) € [0,1]. If our experiment
consisted of having our hand over a coin and then looking to see
whether heads or tails was up, then it would be reasonable to use
the probability measure with y(O) = 1/2 and to say that the probability
was fifty-fifty for a head or a tail Clearly, our use of pro-
bability here is due to our ignorance of the true state of the coin
until we lift our hand. On the other hand, if our experiment con-
sisted of tossing a coin and then seeing whether it landed up heads
or tails, then, again, it would be reasonable to say that the
probability was fifty-fifty for a head. or a tail. to appear. But
it would no longer be clear that our use of probability language
was due to any ignorance on our part. One could easily consider
tossing a coin to be anintrinsically stochastic process; and, in
fact, this is the common sense point of view. On the other hand,

a true believer in the classical world view could argue that the

--- Page 42 ---
41

result of a coin toss was as determined by the initial conditions
of its environment as was the result of our lifting our hand, the
"only" difference being one of computational difficulty. Thus, while
in practice it is usual - even in classical probability theory - to
often consider intrinsically stochastic processes, it is always
possible in a classical theory to assume that our use of probability
is only a reflection of our ignorance and/or computational weakness,
Moving on, we next consider a configuration space appropriate
to describing a particle. If our experiment consisted of taking a flash
picture of a single billiard ball on a pool table in a dark
room, then the appropriate configuration space would
be R? or-even a rectangular subset of R’. Clearly, any use of pro-
bability language here is due to our ignorance of the actual location
of the billiard ball. On the other hand, if the experiment consisted
of tossing a rock over our shoulder into a lake and having a friend
record the location of the splash, then, again, R? would be an appro-
priate configuration space for our system, but the system could
easily be conceived of as being intrinsically stochastic. We will
see in §2.3 that thinking of atomic models more along the lines of
the above rock tossing experiment than of the billiard ball experi-
ment allows one to carry out Boltzmann's program for classical
statistical mechanics without having to invoke either ensembles or
ergodic theorems. Suppose now that we throw two rocks, one colored
red and the other blue. If our friend is not color blind,then he
could record the location of the splash of the red rock and the «»**

location of the splash of the blue rock, Hence, R2 x Rr? would be

--- Page 43 ---
42

an appropriate configuration space for this system. If our friend
is color-blind, then he would only be capable of recording the
locations of the two splashes, but not which was caused by the red
rock, In this situation, the surface configuration space (ois could
be chosen to be the space of unordered pairs of points (repetitions
allowed) in R2 (this space is isomorphic to R? x R*/Za, i.e. the

quotient space of R2 x R? by the natural interchange action of Zo

on it). Clearly, the use of this 2 instead of R? % R? is entirely
due to our friend's ignorance, i.e. his being color-blind, and we
could choose R? x R? for our deep configuration space ef and

y:e% ~ ae to be the natural quotient map. On the other hand, if

our experiment consisted of photographing the location of bubbles

on a turbulent lake, then an appropriate surface configuration space
might be the space of finite subsets of a region in R?, There is

no natural way to label bubbles or to talk about "interchanging"

a pair of bubbles. Bubbles are momentary, unstable, localized
structures in the lake. A move analogous to that made above of
using R? x R? as a deep configuration. space, while possible here,
would be unnatural and inappropriate here. The use of the con-
figuration space of finite subsets of a region in R2 in these
circumstances should not be attributed to our ignorance, but to

the system under consideration. If one were interested in describing
the water itself, or some other continuous medium such as a deformed
string or membrane, then the appropriate configuration space would

be some infinite-dimensional function space,

--- Page 44 ---
43

§2.2. Dynamics,

So far we have said nothing sbout time-and the dynamics of our
systems, Suppose now that our billiard ball is rolling on the billiard
table and that our camera has a timing device which allows us to take
a_single flash photograph at any of a finite number T of possible
time delays. Then the appropriate surface configuration space would

consist of T disjoint copies of a rectangle:

c= (Rilrer = ST a eo mm}

1 422 t=T :

Of course, we really believe that the billiard ball is a "lasting
particular" and that one could take the function space rR? as the
deep configuration space ef with the evaluations at various times
determining the map pir? ~ {R,} in gpro-Top. Taking Ro as the deep
configuration space of this system leads to a research program of
attempting to define empirical observables whose associated surface
configuration space would include a copy of R). So, for example,
one would attempt to develop a camera which could take T pictures
after one setting. Success in this venture would lift Ro from being
the deep configuration space up to its also being (a part of) the
surface configuration space.

On the other hand, if our system consists of setting a timing
device which then - at the appropriate time - flings a rock into water

and outputs a photograph of the splash, then, again, {R,} would be

--- Page 45 ---
44

the appropriate surface configuration space, but we would no longer
consider RT as an appropriate deep configuration space since there

is no "splash" which is lasting over time. Rr? would be the appropriate
configuration space for a system which flings rocks at times

t = 1,2,...,T and outputs T photographs of their splashes (with the
time t printed on the bottom of the photograph). Here, there is no
lasting particular, but there is a path!

If time is modeled as the continuum Ri, then there is again no
problem in defining the surface configuration space to be a
where Ct is the configuration space of possible results at time t.

If we now want to model a lasting particular, such as a billiard
ball, we must choose some appropriate function space which we will
denote by ec. yer - {e,} is again determined by evaluation at the
various times. A theory will tell us which probability measures on
a are actually empirically realizable. For describing a billiard
ball, one would naturally tend only to include continuous or even
piecewise smooth paths in a

One simple way of generating an interesting dynamical theory is
to assume that one is given a continuous one-parameter group U, of
homeomorphisms of a space @. The association c - U,¢e determines a
map @ — et and hence a map Prob(@) - Prob(a!), If U, is a smooth
action, then it is completely determined by its infinitesimal generator
X which is a smooth vector field on @. Thus, in Aristotlean mechanics
one might try to describe the behavior of a billiard ball by giving
a vector field on i”. If the surface on which the ball moved was

sufficiently rough, then this description might even be reasonably

--- Page 46 ---
45

accurate. But most of the time it would turn out to be very poor,
as was first fully realized by Galileo. A billiard ball seems to
have other intrinsic qualities beyond mere position, This idea can
be formalized by assuming that the actual deep configuration space
appropriate for a billiard ball is a space @' together with a con-
tinuous map einen’. The simplest way to obtain such a pair
(a',7) is to assume that the internal qualities of the billiard
ball are described by a space F and take R? x F for @' and the
natural projection map for 7. More generally, one might describe
the qualities of a system by a space T(C) which fibers over the
space @ of external qualities.

The symmetry properties of @ and T(@) play an important role
in the development of many theories. For example, for a particle
the appropriate external configuration space would be R° and the
natural action of the Euclidean group E, on R® plays a very
important role in most theories of particles. It is natural to
suppose in this case that the natural action of E3 on R® lifts to
a compatible action on the total configuration space T(R°). More
generally, if G is a symmetry group acting on the external config-
uration space @, then we will assume that the action of G lifts to
T(c). If we take for G the full diffeomorphism group of @, then the
possibilities for T(@) are probably quite limited. Some possibilities
are: a) the tangent and cotangent bundles of @ and tensor products

of these vector bundles; b) the projective and Grassman bundles

associated to the examples in a); c) various jet bundles. It would

--- Page 47 ---
46

be interesting to actually determine all (reasonable) possibilities.

A vector field X on T(@) determines a trajectory c(t) € r(e)®*
for every point c € T(¢). Composing with the map #:T(¢@) +@ yields
mec(t) € oF and hence we obtain a map from the full static con-
figuration space T(@) to the external dynamic configuration space a.
In Hamiltonian dynamics one also assumes that group actiens on
T(@) are generated by Hamiltonian vector fields which are themselves
determined by smooth observables. In particular, one assumes that
T(@) comes equipped with a natural symplectic structure and that
all groups act via symplectomorphisms (i.e., contact transformations).
The simplest example here is the cotangent bundle Te of ©. What
are the other possibilities? Te is the natural object to take if
one thinks of translations on iat What extended structures correspond
to the full Euclidean group? (See §3)

Taking Te for one's deep static configuration space and choosing
a Hamiltonian H:T*a ~ R to determine the dynamics yields most of
the special structure characteristic of classical mechanics. In
particular, H is usually chosen to be the sum T+V of two parts: aN
the kinetic energy, which is determined by a Riemannian metric on
¢@; and V, the potential energy, which is determined by a scalar
function on @. Isometries of (2,7) which leave V invariant lift to
Te is such a way as to be invariant under the dynamics determined
by H; their generators are thus invariants of the motion, i.e., we
obtain the classical conservation laws (e.g., those of conservation
of energy, momentum, and angular momentum). A similar Hamiltonian

theory for systems of infinitely many degrees of freedom is still

--- Page 48 ---
47

under development.

In the theories above we have a static total configuration space
@' and a map o':¢0' = ok which induces a map py :Prob(c') - Prob(e® J.
The dynamics is completely deterministic and any recourse to the use
of probability is due to starting with a probability measure with
dispersion on @'. This may be necessary due to our ignorance of

the "actual" initial state in @'. In Wiener's theory of Brownian

motion, we are also given a map X,:Prob(@') - prob(e® ), but X,is

no longer induced by a map x:C' 7 a » i.@€., the dynamics is
intrinsically stochastic, In this case, unlike the two above, ©'

enters only as a computational device which enables us to compute

the appropriate probability measures on ak . Generally speaking,

physicists have taken the phase space Te much more seriously, perhaps
too seriously, (but see the next section). Hamiltonian mechanics is

a powerful and beautiful theory, but it has led to an overemphasis
on Te in contrast to ok . The essence of the notion of a particle
is that of a lasting particular, and oc is the appropriate con-

figuration space for describing a lasting particular. .

§2.3. Classical Statistical Mechanics.

There are two basic approaches to the study of systems such as
a container of gas. In thermodynamics one takes a phenomenological
approach and treats the gas as a basic entity and develops macro-
scopic observables - such as temperature, pressure, volume, density -
and one attempts to discover laws governing their behavior - such
as Boyle's Law and Charles' Law. On the other hand, one might
attempt to model the gas as an enormous collection of very small
molecules. The molecules could, in first approximation, be viewed
as point particles or as hard spheres obeying Newton's Laws or)
better yet, Hamiltonian mechanics. One would thus describe the

state of the gas by a point in pon where N is the number of molecules

in the gas. Observables would correspond to functions on Ro’, and
the dynamics of the gas would be governed by a Hamiltonian. The

goal of statistical mechanics is to show how the phenomenological
observables and laws of thermodynamics can be "reduced" to correspond-
ing observables and laws of the molecular model. So far, all such
reductionistic attempts have failed. The so-called paradoxes of
reversal and recurrence show that, at best, one can only obtain from
the molecular Hamiltonian model that the thermodynamical description
is very probable, but not necessary. "Fluctuations" away from equi-
librium will occur and will be important. This, by itself, is already
an important accomplishment in that it focuses our attention on
macroscopic phenomena that we may have overlooked as "just noise".

w
But even this ‘at best requires that the Hamiltonian flow be ergodic

--- Page 50 ---
49

on the energy hypersurface - a result which was only comparatively
recently proved by Sinai in the special case of hard spheres in a
box. Backing off a bit, one can follow Gibbs' approach based upon
ensembles of similarly prepared systems and try to show that the
thermodynamical laws, while not strictly true of individual systems,
are true of equilibrium ensembles. An ensemble will be described
by a probability measure on the phase space wv. Each system in
the ensemble is to be thought of in terms of the above molecular
model. Hence, appeal to probability language here is strictly
pragmatic. The individual system will usually not be in equilibrium;
but if the Hamiltonian flow is ergodic, then almost any ensemble
will approach equilibrium in the sense that its probability measure
on poN will “approach” the unique invariant probability measure.

A very different viewpoint is suggested by our development in
81. Instead of viewing a molecular model in terms of lots of little
billiard balls, we can instead view it as implying a mode of per-
ception (i.e the (at least theoretical) existence of an appropriate
microscope) capable of looking at a gas and seeing a large collection
of "molecules"; the result of such a look is to be recorded as a point

in pon From this point of view, one may very well describe a single

sample of gas by a probability measure on pon while disclaiming any
lack of knowledge. The process of looking may be as intrinsically
stochastic as the process of tossing a coin. One may now question
whether the dynamics of the system should be described by a Hamiltonian

flow. Possibly a Markov process or some other more general stochastic

process may be appropriate for generating the time semigroup on

--- Page 51 ---
50

Prob(R°Y), Maybe, even, the probability measures satisfy the
Boltzmann equation! Now it is possible for a single sample of
gas to be in equilibrium while at the same time repeated observa-
tions of it yield fluctuations (think of repeated tossings of a
hundred fair coins)! Thus, it is possible to have a"molecular
model’ of a gas with a classical depth logic and to obtain from

it both the laws of thermodynamics and also fluctuation laws
without having to appeal to either ergodic theorems or to Gibbs’
ensembles! Of course, one has here given up the classical atomic
ontology. Our molecules do not have independent existence; they
are more like the "splashes" of §§2.1 and 2.2. Had Boltzmann
suggested such a move, he probably would have been laughed at.
But such a move is now, in any case, necessitated by quantum
mechanics. So, if it also helps when the deep logic is Boolean,

why not make it?

§2.4. Field Theory,

The theory of continuous models was developed in the eighteenth
and early ninteenth centuries by L. Euler et. al in order to describe
the behavior of such diverse systems as vibrating strings,
membranes and other elastic structures; heat conduction; sound waves;
diffusion processes; fluid flow. All these systems were actually
viewed as being fundamentally discrete (i.e. made up of atoms), and
the continuous models were viewed as merely phenomenological
theories (i.e. approximations not having fundamental significance).
It wasn't until Faraday's conception of electric and magnetic lines
of force that a field theory was viewed as fundamental (i.e., as
a basic building block of the universe, having the same ontological
status as atoms). But Faraday's ideas weren't well understood by
his contemporaries. His mode of expression was essentially that of
a twentieth century geometric topologist and not that of a ninteenth
century mathematical physicist. Maxwell translated Faraday's
intuitions into the more acceptable language of partial differential
equations and founded the theory of the electro-magnetic field. (The
relationship between the work of Faraday and Maxwell is essentially
identical with the relationship between algebraic and differential
topology in the d’Rham theory.) But even for Maxwell, the electro-
magnetic field was viewed as essentially a phenomenological device
similar to temperature. He sought for underlying mechanistic atomic
models. It wasn't until Hertz that the true fundamental significance
of the electro-magnetic field was fully realized. With the advent

of relativity theory, ontology had come full circle since in

--- Page 53 ---
52

relativity theory it is very natural to only consider fields as
having basic ontological existence. There is no way to end this
dialectic since one can probably always reduce discrete models
to continuous ones and vice versa. In quantum mechanics one.
settles the dialectic with the slogan that the two approaches are
"complementary". (In the classical case one also has, of course,
that the appropriate phase spaces are isomorphic as Borel spaces.)
In the middle of the twentieth century, due mainly to the
work of N. Wiener and A. Kolmogorov, one had the development of a
statistical theory of random fields. The goal of this theory is
to describe such complex phenomena as noise and turbulence by
direct statistical assumptions on the properties of the fields.
For example, one might assume that a fluid flow is to be described
by a vector field on R’, i.e. by a function from R? to R?. On
the space of such vector fields 7 one assumes the existence of a
probability measure y which determines the statistical properties
of the fluid under consideration, i.e. if we measure the fluid flow,
then the resulting vector field will lie in a Borel set A CJ with
probability p(A). One might naturally investigate first the statis-
tically homogeneous flows, i.e. those whose probability measures
are invariant under the induced action Of the Euclidean group Ey on
gZ from its natural action on R*. Since p is a fairly complicated
object, most work is done by simply making assumptions concerning
the moments of the velocity field, e.g. assumptions on
E(v, (x)), E(v, (x) v5 (y)), etc. Recently, attempts have been made to

reduce this intrinsically stochastic theory back to the deterministic

--- Page 54 ---
53

theory of the Navier-Stokes equations, This work has been buoyed
up by the expectation that the flow described by these equations
contains a "strange attractor". A dynamical system with such an
attractor would have a very complex time evolution. But turbulence
is also very complicated at a single time. Recalling the situation
in classical statistical mechanics, one would expect that the
deterministic model could, at best, obtain the same results as
the statistical theory only "most of the time". It seems most
unlikely that the statistical assumptions made by the statistical
theory (e.g. homogeneous chaos) could be derived from the deter-
ministic theory. If they could, one would, of course, feel that
one had gained a greater understanding of such phenomena as turbu-
lence, We guess that one can't, in general, obtain such a derivation
and that, furthermore, experiment will support the statistical
approach, In other words, our attitude towards turbulence is similar
to our attitude towards a gas (and also a coin toss); they are both
intrinsically stochastic phenomena. From a pragmatic point of view,
this has certainly been the approach of applied mathematicians
attempting to model such complicated phenomena, But we are going
further and suggesting that these stochastic models may be fundamental,
and not just useful because of our computational weakness,

Such stochastic theories as homogeneous chaos have been Lately
arising quite frequently. For example, besides its occurrence in the
statistical theory of turbulence, it is also used in the statistical

mechanics of infinite systems and in the Euclidean approach to quantum

--- Page 55 ---
54

field theory (see §3). Recently, Mandelbrot published a facinating
book using a general theory of random sets to describe such diverse
phenomena as. Cloud patterns, shapes of island boundaries and
rivers, the pattern of arteries and veins in the lungs. In these
models, the sample set is monstrous with probability one. The
prototype is, of course, Brownian motion with its nowhere differenti-
able sample paths. Mandelbrot's samples usually have Hausdorf
dimension greater than their covering dimension; hence, the samples
are spaces that one usually only thinks of as occurring in courses
in general topology. But Mandelbrot makes a strong case for the
claim that such monsters are all about us if we only care to look.
He even suggests that physicists have independently discovered the
notion of Hausdorf dimension in trying to describe some of the
phenomena he considers,

We haven't even touched upon the biological and social sciences
where almost all models are (or should be) stochastic. Most novel
in some of these models is the use of game theory to describe con-
flict situations. But, to our knowledge at least, all of the models
used so far in the biological and social sciences can be formulated
in terms of classical (Boolean) probability theory. In the next

section we discuss non-classical theories.

§3. Quantum Theories.

In §2 we have considered various classical systems all of
which have a depth logic which is either Boolean or a disjoint
collection of Boolean logics. Thus, for the most part, classical
systems are characterized by having all of their (theoretical)
observables compatible, i.e., there is a single (theoretical)
perspective from which one aan see all there is to be seen. In
order to obtain a truly non-classical theory, one must assume
that the deep logic is non-Boolean and that its Boolean subatgebras
interlock in a complex fashion. That quantum mechanics contains
incompatible observables, such as the position and momentum
observables, Q and P, was first realized by Dirac and Heisenberg
in late 1926, This observation was not forced upon them by
experimental failures to measure simultaneously the exact position
and momentum of a particle; in fact, Planck's constant h is so
small and our technology so weak, that even if an electron were a
small classical billiard ball, no existing experiment could test
Heisenberg's conclusion in his y-ray microscope gedenken experiment.
Instead, they came, to their conclusion from the realization that
the highly successful quantum mechanical formalism that had recently
been established did not enable one to predict a joint probability
distribution for Q and P. Thus, either the quantum mechanical
algorithm, while very successful for some purposes, was statistically
incomplete in that it did not enable one to predict the joint pro-

bability distributions for Q and P, or else the quantum mechanical

--- Page 57 ---
56
algorithm was statistically complete and hence Q and P didn't have
a joint probability distribution, i.e., they were both empirically
and theoretically incompatible. Thus, if one takes the quantum
mechanical formalism very seriously and assumes that it is at least
statistically complete, then one is forced to the conclusion (or
discovery) that quantum mechanics contains incompatible observables.
This approach can be summarized by Einstein's remark to Heisenberg:
"It is the theory which decides what we can observe." Heisenberg's
y-ray microscope gedanken experiment was an attempt to retroactively
rationalize and justify this viewpoint. He took Einstein's con-
tribution to relativity theory as his paradigm. In Einstein's
case also the formalism had already been established; and Poincaré
at least was clearly aware that it called for a.radical break with
classical (Galilean) mechanics. But Einstein's approach via
gedanken experiments involving rods and clocks was much more vivid
and convincing. Thus, Einstein's approach was a way to rationalize
the disappearance of an absolute notion of simultaneity, a dis-
appearance which was already implied by taking the Lorentz group
seriously, and taking the Lorentz group seriously was already
implicit in the success and structure of Maxwell's theory. Of course,
one also had the Michaelson-Morley experiment. In his gedanken
experiment, Heisenberg essentially shows that if Q. is a position

experiment with accuracy « and P, is a momentum experiment with

6
accuracy 6, then a necessary condition that a, and P, be compatible
is that ¢€°§6 2 h. Note that Heisenberg's analysis here involves only

the "old" quantum mechanics<-in particular, wave-particle duality

--- Page 58 ---
57

‘ and the Einstein-de Broglie relations. This inequality is totally
unrelated to the similar-appearing inequality concerning statistical
scatter relations which is easily derivable using the formalism

of the "new" quantum mechanics. Heisenberg's gedanken experiment
was as successful as Einstein's in providing a lucid and convincing
rationalization of the established formalism. (Unfortunately for
Heisenberg, Einstein wasn't particularly appreciative of the compli-

ment of having his (former) approach followed. He is reputed to

have remarked that"a good joke shouldn't be repeated too often".)

§3.1 The Logic of Quantum Mechanics.

Upon leaving the classical (eatwan) tradition, one enters a
chaos of possible deep logics. First, one investigates the simpler
possibilities. Probably the simplest (and definitely the most
important) non-Boolean deep logics are those obtained by assuming
that 2 is ‘isomorphic to the diagram of Boolean sub-algebras of
the orthocomplemented lattice of orthogonal projections on a
Hilbert space. We will shortly see that this assumption "works",
i.e., is capable of yielding the oo results of traditional
quantum mechanics. But one can go even further and show how certain
reasonable cuando on a certain class of experimental situations
actually yields deep logics which can be shown to be embeddable in
Proj(H). This has been done, for example, by Sneed [67]:° Sneed”
main goal was to show that classical probability theory is completely
adequate for describing certain quantum mechanical phenomena. He
considers "finite filter experiments" which are an idealization of
standard polarization experiments. He then shows how classical
probability theory is capable of formulating all the questions one
might have about such a system. Using certain "reasonable" axioms
concerning the filters, he is able to show how one is led to intro-
duce a certain orthomodular orthocomplemented lattice L and that the
probabilities that one is interested in- determine probability-like
measures on L. Furthermore, L is embeddable in Proj(H), and every
probability measure on L is induced by one on Proj(H). Thus, the
standard quantum mechanics based upon Proj(H) is computationally

adequate for describing any finite filter experiment. A similar

--- Page 60 ---
59

viewpoint is implicit in The Feynman Lectures on Physics and in
work of Ludwig. On the other hand, we don't want to provide too
strong a justification for the axiom that Pe = Proj(H), since it
is known that other assumptions are appropriate in quantum statistical
mechanics and in quantum field theory. In these subjects it is
often reasonable to assume that zo = Proj(@), where @ is a von Neumann °
algebra (or more generally a E*-algebra (see [19]). Alternatively,
if one works with the partial algebra ao of continuous real-valued
observables, then one is led to assume that @, = Herm(@), where @
isa c*-algebra and Herm(@) is its partial algebra of Hermitian
elements. (A natural question that arises here is whether @ is
determined by Proj(q) or Herm(@), i.e., if Herm(@,) = Herm(@,) (as
partial algebras), then is @, = @,? Note that Herm(@,) = Herm(@,)
does not imply that ay = ao if ay and Io are only assumed to be real
c* -algebras: consider the complex numbers C and the quaterions H as
real c*-algebras, then Herm(C) = Herm(H) @ R!) Furthermore, it is possible
that some of the difficulties occurring in quantum field theory in four
dimensional space-time concerning the definability of commutators will
require for their resolution the assumption that such commutators are
not definable, i.e., that a, is an "exceptional" partial algebra not
isomorphic to Herm(@) for any c*-algebra a

Suppose now that zo = Proj(H). Since a real-valued observable
on zo is defined to be a g-homomorphism from the Borel algebra of R
to Z, it follows from von Neumann's spectral theorem that such observ-
ables are in 1-1 correspondence with the hypermaximal Hermitian

operators on H. Furthermore, the partial algebra Fn of bounded measurable

--- Page 61 ---
60
observables associated to “3 is isomorphic to the partial algebra
Herm(B(H)) of bounded Hermitian operators on H. Similar results
clearly hold for 2! = Proj(@), where 7 is a von Neumann algebra.
The next problem is to describe the probability measures on Z*,
Clearly, every unit vector 4 € H determines a probability measure

on 2 by the formula Hy (P) = (Pho). is called a vector state

By, Hy
on £4, One can also form countable convex sums of vector states to

obtain more general states yp = 5 Wihy - Such a yp can alternatively be
cf!

defined by the formula by (P) = Tr(PW), where W is a von Neumann density
matrix (i.e., W is a positive self-adjoint operator of trace 1). One
naturally asks if these are all the probability measures on 2%, For
H = c? the answer is a definitive no! One can embed the logic Proj (C7)
into a Boolean algebra and thereby obtain lots of dispersion free
probability measures on Proj(C”). Thus, for H = c? one can contradict
the Heisenberg uncertainty relations and also construct classical
"hidden variables" models which are strict reductions (see [2] and
{41]. In 1957 Gleason showed that for dim H 2 3 all probability
measures on Proj(H) can be represented by von Neumann density matrices.
That Proj (C“) is not "really" a quantum mechanical logic should
come as no surprise since its diagram of Boolean subalgebras is an
(uncountable) disjoint collection of copies of the Boolean algebra
(O-P-1) with all the subalgebras (0-1) identified. One needs more
"coherence" in 2 before one obtains truly non-classical phenomena.
iS 2! = Proj(@), where @ is a von Neumann algebra with discrete center,

then @ decomposes into a discrete direct sum of factors, @ = ans and

--- Page 62 ---
61

any pure state on @ is determined by a pure state on one of the an:

If oe ~ B(H,)> then every pure state on @ is determined by a vector

in H = @H,, which lies in one of the H,'s- Under these circumstances,
physicists say that there exist super selection rules. If the center

of @ is continuous, then there are no pure states on Proj(@). This

is a very embarrassing circumstance from the traditional point of view
which considers only pure states as representing individuals and maximum
knowledge. It provides no embarrassment - and even a strong argument

in favor of - our point of view where any probability measure on zi

might represent total possible knowledge of individuals.

--- Page 63 ---
62

We haven't even mentioned yet what was for Dirac the essence
of Quantum mechanics: namely, the principle of superposition of
states. Since, by Gleason's theorem, the pure states on Proj (H)
are determined by elements of H, if we are given a family
Cy, 3 of pure states on Proj(H), then we can form new pure state
iy with W= De; e€ H. Hy is called a Quantum mechanical
superposition of the Hy, ° This process is different from the
process of forming classical superpositions such as y=D oe In
general, if $= {uy} is a collection of states on #. then
we will (following Varadarajan [81]) say that yw is a super-
position of the states in § if Hy CP) = 0 Yue &- w(P) = 0.

In the classical situation fin B(X), the pure states correspond

to probability neskives. 6, concentrated at points ae¢X

(assuming X is "reasonable"), all probability measures are
superpositions of the pure ones {6,35 but 6, is not a superposition
of {6,1 |a' # a}. In the Quantum mechanical case, if w= — c,y,;

then is a superposition of {Hy }. So, Quantum mechanics is
3

distinguished from classical mechanics in the fact that even pure
states can be superpositions of each other.

Our next task is to determine the automorphism group of re
We first assume that wa Proj(H), where H is a complex separable
Hilbert space of dimension 23 (similar results hold over the reals
and quaterions). Then it can be shown that every automorphism of
Proj(H) is induced by a unitary or Kak ~eReRD transformation of H.
Automorphisms of Za induce convexity-preserving automorphisms of

Prob (9). Conversely, every convexity-preserving automorphism of Prob(.2°

is induced by an automorphism of 2, But we renind the reader that from our

interpretation of probability, there is no physical argument in favor
of assuming that the maps of Prob (£9) that we are interested in are
convexity-preserving unless we can give physical motivation for their
being induced by maps of ane

We expect the following general phenomena to hold for the cases

non-commuting elements, if every probability measure on such a

If g is a factor (not Ig); then every partial homomorphism of 2

be interesting to know to what extent these hold for exceptional

partial algebras.

§3.2, Dynamics.

The dynamics of a system is usually described by - assuming
that we have an action of R on Prob(#) by convexity-preserving
automorphisms. As was seen in §3.1, this is equivalent to having
a one-parameter group of automorphisms of Z. For fs Proj (H),
one can show that every such group of automorphisms can be induced
by a (strongly continuous) cheated group of unitary trans-
formations of H, U,. By Stone's Theorem U, = oe. where H
is an Hermitian operator called, by analogy with classical mechanics,
the Hamiltonian of the system, and assumed (defined) to be the
observable representing the energy of the system. H is determined
up to an additive constant by the action of R on Proj(H).
Differentiating yields the abstract form of the Schrodinger

equation ov . -iHv. In the more general situations of f~Proj (2)

or a Herm(@), Kadison has shown that one-parameter groupS a,
of convexity-preserving automorphisms of Prob (£%) or #(a,) are
still induced by one-parameter groups a, of convexity—-preserving
automorphisms of Zt or a €Kadison also: assumes-#2---2=* atariel. vs
that all partial states are states). But in these more general
cases, a one-parameter group of automorphisms of a may not be
induced by a — group of unitary operators in a, LO ing
there may be no observable "energy". On the other hand, if each
automorphism Oy of the one-parameter group is inner (i.e., induced
by a unitary operator in a), then-under physically reasonable
hypotheses-the one-parameter group is generated by a one-parameter
unitary group UL= gee and there is an observable energy H

Up to now our model of the experimental process is that of a
box with a timer and buttons: the timer is set to any time ty eR
and a button Ay is pressed yielding a result ,* , and then
the box blows up (see §1). But suppose instead that the box has
many timers and that we could set them for various times tye R
and choose various buttons Ay such that we obtain a sequence
of values as hy. before the box blows up. What are we to do?
The logically most consistent approach is to begin afresh and
consider the sequence {(t,, A,)} as a single new experiment. We
would thus be led to introduce entirely new surface and depth
logics. But there is also a more conservative approach which often-
put not always-suffices. Suppose that the state of the system

assumes that the new state of the coin is equal to its old state.

where p is the probability of a heads. Such a coin, if left to
itself, seeks to become unbiased. Note, also, that the time
semi-group is not acting in a convexity-preserving way on the
states. If a box filled with such coins is shaken after a long
rest, then one would expect approximately equal numbers of heads
and tails to result. But if by chance there is a preponderance
of heads, then upon an immediate retrial one would expect the
preponderance to be sustained. One could generalize this example
by Supposing that the bias has only a probability of changing
after a toss.

Now let us return to quantum mechanics. Let A be an Hermitian
operator with discrete non-degenerate eigenvalues= {@, } and
associated eigen-vectors {¥ }. Then a standard assumption in
quantum.mechanics is that no matter what the original state yp
is, the state after A is measured and a; is obtained will
be py - This assumption of "reduction of the wave packet" makes
the armen mechanics system behave in a manner analogous to our
coins which become totally biased after having been forced into
making a decision. If A has degenerate or continuous eigenvalues)
then one only obtains the restriction that if the measured value of

A lies in ECR, then the new state is for some W ¢€ Pp,

§3.3. The Quantum Theory of Particles.

We will now consider the quantum mechanical notion of a
particle. Suppose we have a system which has a position observable
Q which yields a result in R° and that the system is invariant
with respect to an action of the Euclidean group E3 (= the group
of transformations of R® generated by translations and rotations),
i.e., we are given actions of E on Lab, R°, ry such that the maps

P and Lab - Prob (2°) are equivariant, where the action on

a(R) al
Prob (£°) is the natural one induced by the action of E, on z.

In the classical case one usually takes 2 2 a(T*R) with the action

of E, on T*R? induced by its natural action on R® and the inclusion
B(R°) —> (T*R?) induced by the natural projection map T*R? - R°, In

the case of the standard quantum logic 2! = Proj(H), one can show

that there is a natural 1-l correspondence between isomorphism

classes of equivariant maps (e(R°) ,E3) ad (Proj (H) , E3) (called systems

of imprimitivity for (6(R*) ,E5)) and isomorphism classes of (projective)
representations of SO(3). If V is a (projective) representation of
so(3), then the system of imprimitivity corresponding to it has a
natural representation in L7(R?,v) = L?(R3) @® V. Usually one pays
special attention to the "irreducible" systems of imprimitivity, i.e.,
those for which B(H) is the smallest von Neumann algebra containing

the projections P, for E € B(R°) (i.e., the projections occurring in

the spectral resolutions of the position observables) and also the

projections occurring in the spectral resolutions of the momentum

observables (i.e., the infinitesimal generators of the unitary

--- Page 70 ---
69

one-parameter groups inducing the one-parameter groups of auto-
morphisms of Proj(H) which are determined by the one-parameter
sub-groups of E3). In other words, if t:(6(R®) , B5) oe (Proj (H) , E,)

is an irreducible system of imprimitivity, then every observable

in Herm(B(H)) is a "function" of the position and momentum observ-
ables. (Note that this notion of function is purely mathematical and
not physical; it depends upon the full algebra (and Ww’) structure

of B(H) and not only its (more physical) partial algebra structure.)

Given {| : (e(R*) , E5) ~ (Proj(H,),E3) (i = 1,2), then we can form
= 1 © fo: (B(R*),E,) ~ (Proj(H, © Hy), E5)

as follows. For g ¢€ E3 let u, (8) be a unitary operator on Hq, inducing
the action of g on Proj (H, ). (Since Es is a connected Lie group, every
element of it is a square, and, hence, when E, acts as an automorphism
group of Proj(H), each such automorphism is induced by a unitary
operator on H.) Let U(g) = U, (g) io) Ug (g) be the direct- sum unitary
operator on H = Hy ® Ho, and let E3 act on Proj(H) via the induced
action determined by U(g). For E € a(R’), let ¢(E) = t, (E) @ &o(E).
Then § is equivariant. Given an arbitrary family {t,}, one can similarly
define 8t;- Note that this construction would not work in general for
the unrestricted Euclidean group which contains the reflections and

is thus not connected because if r is the reflection about the x-axis
and if 0 (r) is induced by a unitary operator U,(r) and lo (r) is induced
by an anti-unitary operator U3 (r), then U,(r) © Uy (x) is neither uni-

tary nor anti-unitary, and hence does not determine an automorphism of

to(t) = elHt are anti-unitarily equivalent actions of R! on H,,
and hence are isomorphic actions on Proj(H;), but €, © €, is not
isomorhic to C1 ® Ci: The importance of the direct sum construction
lies in the fact that every system of imprimitivity for (e(R*) ,E3)
is isomorphic to a direct sum of irreducible such systems, The
irreducible systems of imprimitivity for (8(R°) Eg)
correspond to the irreducible (projective)
representations of SO(3) and these are standardly denoted by D;» where
j is a half integer. The dimension of D; is 2j+l and the representation
is an ordinary one if and only if j is an integer. In any case,
associated to any system of imprimitivity for (8(R°) , Ey) (in a complex
Hilbert space H) we have the special observables of position Q,5
momentum Pos and angular momentum J, (these observables are associated
to (unbounded) Hermitian operators on H). One can now derive the
Heisenberg commutation relations [Q;,P;] = -/-1, and hence the
Heisenberg uncertainty relations QR, * 5 21/2. Note that these
uncertainty relations say nothing about ones ability to make simultaneous
measurements of Q; and Pi 3; in fact, the non-vanishing of [Q, .P;]
implies that Q3 and Ps are incompatible. These uncertainty relations
are purely statistical scatter relations governing the statistics of
independent measurements of Q; and Pi The main theorem required for
the above derivation is Gleason's theorem asserting that the probability
measures on Proj(H) can all be represented by density matrices. Given

this, one can easily show (using the Schwartz inequality) that

point is whether or not there is a classical analog of the intrinsic
spin of a particle. That the answer is yes is quite recent! If

one thinks of a particle as a small billiard ball, then it is natural
to assume that the particle can rotate. This leads one to replace

the configuration space R° by the configuration space R° x SO(3).

every system of imprimitivity for (e(R°) ,B5) is of this form. In
particular, the system corresponding to the (projective) representation
D; of SO(3) is not of this form. In L?(R?) @ D, we have the extra
angular momentum observables 85, but we do not have any extra orienta-
tion observables. Classically this corresponds to replacing the phase

is not an extended billiard ball type of particle, but,
and TR x s? are the only Euclidean invariant
symplectic manifolds over R° whose points are separated by the functions
corresponding to the basic observables Q,> Pi, Jj. One thus refers
to these systems as "elementary" (sumplectic) systems of imprimitivity
for (e(R*) , Eg). s” is an elementary system for SO(3), and one can
also obtain elementary systems for E3- By and large, we feel that
too much emphasis has been placed upon the "elementary" systems and
not enough upon the composite or reducible systems (such as
t*(R® x so(3)) = R°).

There has been much recent work in extending the above anaiysis
to cases where (Rg, Eg) is replaced by some other pair (M,G), and even
further to cases where one is only given the classical phase space
P (assumed to be a Symplectic manifold). In a different direction,
if one assumes that 23 = Proj(@), where & is a von Neumann algebra,
and that E3 acts via inner automorphisms, then von Neumann's theorem
concerning the essential uniqueness of the representations of the
Heisenberg commutation relations implies that @ contains a direct
sum of | and that on each summand we have a standard Schrodinger
representation, We don't know whether or not there exist other systems

of imprimitivity for (g(R°) , Eg) in Proj(#), with Ez not acting by

--- Page 74 ---
73

inner automorphisms,

The main point, so far, is that the physicist’ standard quantum
kinematical description of a particle - including the Heisenberg
commutation relations and uncertain principle, the Schrodinger
representation in terms of wave functions on R°, the notion of the
intrinsic spin of a particle, and the superposition principle - follows

from the single assumption that “a

Symmetry assumptions! We shall now go further and assume that the
dynamics of our system is compatible with its kinematics, i.e., that
the action of the one-parameter time group T on 2! commutes with
the action of E3 on 2, If our system of imprimitivity is the one
corresponding to Do and represented in 25(R°), then, by using Fourier
transforms, one can show that the Hamiltonian H = g (Pi +P54P) = g(-97),
where g is some Borel function on iaget If one assumes that g is smooth
and approximates it by its first order Taylor expansion, then one has

For the case of higher spin D; one can show - using the theory of
group representations - that H is determined by 2j+1 real-valued
functions on R*,

What we have, in effect, assumed is that the action of E3 on Pi
extends to an action of the Newtonian space-time group E3 x T on 2",

One can go further and assume that the action of Ey extends to an

--- Page 75 ---
74

action of the Galilean or Lorentz group.In the case of the Galilean
group, one can show that H = = = v. For the Lorentz group, one
has various possibilities, but , in any case, one always has the

mc* - c2y, More generally, one considers (projective)

relation #2 =
representations of a space-time group G, whether or not they extend

a system of imprimitivity for (g(R°) Ey). Irreducible such representa-
tions are often said to describe "elementary particles". But the

term elementary systems is often more appropriate since these systems
often lack many of the properties that we usually associate with the
word particle. For example, the representations of the Lorentz group
which are thought to describe photons, neutrinos, and gravitons cannot
be localized, i.e., they do not extend a system of imprimitivity for
(2(R*) , Ey) (nor even one for (a(R*),G)). The corresponding classical
phase space for these systems is R? x s? 3; we thus have energy,
momentum, and angular momentum observables for these systems, but

no location observables. Other representations of the Lorentz group
are often said not to be of physical significance since they imply

that the energy may be negative, or always zero, or that the mass
parameter may be imaginary. We feel that these are inadequate grounds
for eliminating the consideration of these representations; in fact,

we shall shortly see that many of these representations occur in the

decomposition of certain natural occurring reducible representations

of G.

--- Page 76 ---
75

So far we have considered physical systems which are described
using systems of imprimitivity for (e(R°) ,E) or representations of
the (inhomogeneous) Lorentz group. One can also consider systems
whose description requires a system of imprimitivity for the Lorentz
gropp. Suppose we have an experimental setup which yields an "event"
in Rt and admits the Lorentz group L as a symmetry group. Such a
system will be described by a system of imprimitivity for (g(R*) ,L).
Systems of imprimitivity for (e(R*,L) are classified by the
(projective) representations of the homogeneous Lorentz group L.
One will now have a time observable T along with the position
observables Q;. Thus, one will also have the commutation relation
[T,H] = i, and hence the (much used) uncertainty principle AT-AH 2 1/2.
The resulting representation of L will not be irreducible. Furthermore,
representations usually ignored in particle physics will occur in its
decomposition as a direct integral of irreducibles. It is quite
possible that phenomena such as resonances might be better thought
of as "events" rather than "particles". Even the electron is not
completely particle-like. At any time we choose, we will find "it"
somewhere; but there are no paths. One can construct a quantum
mechanical theory of particles with paths. Let C be the six dimensional
homogeneous space of time-like lines in R*, L acts transitively on C.
Systems of imprimitivity for (@(C),L) have the most right to be said
to be describing "particles". Such systems are classified by (projective
representations of SO(3) x R. Of course, the associated representation
of L is not irreducible. Other possibilities readily come to mind --

in particular, theories based upon time-like, light-like or space-like

--- Page 77 ---
76

lines or hyperplanes. These theories should be systematically
investigated. In any case, they show that one can have a quantum

mechanical theory of particles with continuous paths.

§3.4. Examples.
In this section we shall show how our formalism works on some

standard examples.

Example 1. Consider first a particle moving in a potential

well described by the graph (3.4.1). What this means

V

lo 12345
i= Q
(3.4.1)

is that we have a basic location observable Q represented by the
unbounded Hermitian multiplication operator Mo acting on ¥ = 27 (RW).
Translations on ri generate a one-parameter unitary group on ¥ whose
infinitesimal generator is t _ = PP. One now assumes that the dynamics
is generated by the Hamiltonian H = os + My. Of course, one has to
check that this sum defines an Hermitian operator on ¥. Furthermore,
one should note that since V is not translation invariant, the space
and time translations will not commute; hence momentum may not be
conserved in time. Suppose one has prepared the system so that if

a position measurement is done at time T = O, then the result recorded
is always approximately 2.5. One usually describes this stiuation

by saying that at time T = O the particle was in the potential well.

One might describe the particle's state by using a wave function as

--- Page 79 ---
78

graphed below.

(3.4.2)
Suppese that at time T = 1 one sometimes finds the particle outside
the well. Then its wave function might look like the following graph.
(We aren't actually solving the wave equation - the points we are

trying to make are qualitative and not quantitative).

rll?

04 2 3 A
(304.23

One usually describes the above situation by saying that the particle
which at time T = O was inside the potential well has a non-zero
probability of "tunneling" out. There are several problems with this
(colorful) language from our point of view. First of all, if we do
not make a position measurement at time T = O, then Q has no value at
time T = 0, even if tke probability was 1 that had we made the measure-
ment the value would have been 2.5! Secondly, if we do measure Q at

T = 0, then we may destroy the system and not be able to make any further

--- Page 80 ---
79

measurements. Thirdly, the language suggests that we are talking

about a system whose basic observable is a continuous path, whereas

the theoretical formalism being used doesn't contain any path questions.
(This is also true of the usual Hamiltonian formulation of classical
mechanics.) Strangely enough, the standard language of the physicist
is often more compatible with some of the hidden variables models

(such as those of Bohm and Nelson) than it is with the Copenhagen
interpretation of Quantum mechanics, (In spite of this, we have

found physicists react very negatively when such hidden variables

theories are mentioned.)

Example 2. We will now consider the classic two slit experiment.
Suppose that at time T=O we find the particle in region A with pro-
bability 1/2 or in region B with probability 1/2 (see diagram

(3.4.4); and that at time T= 1
|
64.4)

we find the particle in region C with probability 1. If we do a large
ensemble of experiments at time T = 1, then what pattern will emerge?

If our particles were billiard balls, then one would expect to see the

solid line curve below emerge.


--- Page 81 ---
80

A similar experiment involving waves would yield an interference

pattern such as figure (3.4.6).

If the experiment is done with electrons, then pattern (3.4.6) emerges
even though at each repetition of the experiment a single location is
observed. A classical model that would reproduce these results can

be obtained by considering bubbles on water, the bubbles lasting

only for a short time and their density being proportional to the

wave intensity. Bohm and Nelson have other semi-classical models.

If we assume that we are looking at a quantum mechanical particle,
then at time T = O the wave function y € £7 (R°,W) would have support
in AUB. Let

w(x) if x€A
v(x) =
4 0 if x ga,
and
w(x) if x €B
p(x) =
oO i?) =e BB.
Then y = va + dp: since Af\B = 98. This sum is a purely mathematical
decompésition: y is a normalized state, but vy and bp are not normalized
states. Of course, by, is a "quantum mechanical" superposition of Hy

od, and p, and not upon wy, and yw, . By Wigner's theorem, the time

observations looking like figure (3.4.6) instead of (3.4.5). This
derivation of the interference pattern rests upon the following: the
assumption that zo = Proj(¥~); Gleason's description of the probability
measures on Proj(w); the Schrodinger representation of ¥; and Wigner's
theorem that time acts linearly on ¥. Furthermore, we represented

the original state by the "pure" probability measure Hy If, instead,

we started with a mixed probability measure, say 5 Hy + 5 Hy then
A B’

pattern (3.4.5) would emerge. Physicists usually only consider pure
states as describing individuals, but we have argued otherwise. It is
often very enlightening to view these experiments from the point of

view of the hidden variable theorists. One can visualize Nelson's model
in the following way. Consider water flowing smoothly in the plane to
the right and two metal pipes above the plane (see diagram below (3.4.7)

below). The pipes can be lowered into

the water and plastic bubbles can be released through their holes
If one pipe is lowered, then one obtains the situation pictured in

figure (3.4.8).

The mixture 5 Hos + z Hyis now physically described as the result

obtained when the above system is prepared as follows: flip a coin
to determine which pipe to lower, then lower that pipe and release
one bubble from the pipe and then record its final location using
the bubble detector (the bubbles are made of plastic to insure that
they live long enough to reach the detector). The superposition

water, and then flipping a coin to determine from which pipe the
bubble should be released. In this model, as also in Bohm's model,

the particles have continuous trajectories.

Example 3. We will now consider a model of the Stern-Gerlach experiment.
A beam of silver atoms is sent through an inhomogeneous magnetic field
and splits into two beams. Let Q denote the basic position observable.

sequences of rotating the magnet. Note that nowhere in this discussion
is it necessary (or possible) to picture a silver atom as a tiny spinning

§3.5. The Quantum Theory of Interacting Particles.

In the previous sections we've considered the quantum theory of
"individual isolated particles." But the world - as seen by the
physicist - is composed of many particles undergoing complex inter-
actions, Suppose, to begin with, that we consider the case of two
"particles". What should the basic observables be? There are two
natural choices. Clearly, the locations of the particles will yield
a pair of points in R°. If our detecting devices can distinguish the
two particles (for examplé, the particles might have different colors, or tastes,
or charges), then our basic observable will yield a result in R°. If
we cannot distinguish the particles, then our basic observable will
yield a result in the space of (unordered) pairs of points in R°. In
either case, it is natural to assume Euclidean invariance. In the
first case one might go further and assume invariance under 83 x $3-
This larger symmetry group would be appropriate if we had two separate
preparing devices and two separate arrays of detectors,one for each
particle, all of which could be independently acted upon by 83 (see

diagram below),

and we discovered that moving PD, by &4 € 63 and PD, by So € 83 had the

same effect as moving Dy by si; and Do by ZS. This would certainly be

the case for "non-interacting" particles. (But, of course, we wouldn't

--- Page 87 ---
86

call particles non-interacting unless this was the case!) In this
case, one can show that the irreducible systems of imprimitivity for
(Rr? x R°, és x 83) all naturally decompose into a tensor product of
two one-particle such systems. A similar result holds for a system of
N particles based upon cr? x R° X wom X R°, 83 x 83 R cam 63). If

we have only one preparing device (see below),

Pp —=+ \ \

Ut ey

then one might discover that moving PD by g has the same effect as

moving both detectors Dy and Dp by a. In this case we are looking

for systems of imprimitivity for (rR? x a, 83), where 8, acts on

R° x R° via the diagonal map 83 Sad é x 33. Here, $, is not acting
transitively on R° x -. What do all the systems of imprimitivity for
cr? x R°, 83) look like? Those which come from a system of imprimitivity
for (rR? x re 83 x 83) by restricting to the diagonal 83 = 83 x 83 can

be shown to be determined by the Clebsch-Gordan series

There are other systems of imprimitivity for cr? x -. 63), though they
are not usually encountered in the physical literature! They describe
systems with a basic configuration observable in R°, but with only the

momentum and angular momentum observables obtainable from the Lie algebra

of 83. One can decompose such systems of imprimitivity into "direct

--- Page 88 ---
87
integrals" of irreducible such systems. A typical orbit of R° x R°
under 83 is homeomorphic to R° x s?. A system of imprimitivity for
(R° x e, 83) can be thought of as describing an “oriented rigid bar."
Possibly some binary molecules could be best described in this way.
We turn now to the case of two “identical particles", i.e., we

have the experimental arrangement (below)

Pp —>\ \

oi/ tl) U ee ~D

where we know that exactly two of the detectors in D will record a
positive result. Assuming Euclidean invariance leads us to look for
system of: imprimitivity for cr? x Bilin, 83)- Two families of such
systems are obtained by starting with a system of imprimitivity for
(R®, 83) and forming either the symmetric or anti-symmetric tensor
product of it with itself. These systems can be realized as spaces of
symmetric or anti-symmetric 1 -wecxenwarewa functions on R° x R?,
There are other natural systems of imprimitivity for (R? x 8 /tgsby).
A typical orbit of 83 acting on R° x R°/Z, is homeomorphic to
R° x RP’, A system of imprimitivity for cr? x RP“, 83) can be thought
of as describing an "unoriented rigid bar". Such a system may be
appropriate for describing molecules composed of two identical atoms,
e.g. the hydrogen molecule Ho:

The above considerations easily extend to the case of N(< @)
particles. What about the case of infinitely many particles? (Even

if one doesn't believe that any "real" system has infinitely many particles

one could still be interested in exploring such models. For example,

--- Page 89 ---
88

they may provide insights into the behavior of very large systems
(N >> 0) while being computationally simpler (recall the relationship
between the binomial and normal distributiong. ) Suppose that we have
a preparing device and a detector and that we expect to record positions
in a region which occur with a density proportional to the region's
volume. Such situations occur frequently, and a theory of random sets -
has been developed (see [53]). Let c(R?) denote the configuration space
of infinite, locally finite subsets of R°. 83 acts naturally on c(R®).
What are all the possible systems of imprimitivity for (c(r’), 63)?
(Work of Mackey and Glimm shows that there is little hope of actually
being able to "survey" all possible such systems; the best we can expect
to do is to explicitly construct large families of such systems!) There
are various possible topologies for c(R®); besides the one usually used
in the theory of random sets [53], one also has an interesting topology
which arises in geometric measure theory [20]. In this second topology,
a small neighborhood of the "vacuum" contains configurations which are
very complicated; the vacuum in this theory is thus more like a Jackson
Pollack painting than an empty canvass! If we use the topology described
in [53], then yp = Bax, where dx is Lebesgue measure on R°, induces an
associated "Poisson" measure Lg on c(r®). 83 acts ergodically on
(CCR) 4 ,), and hence we can obtain a system of imprimitivity for
(c(R*) 64) in L?(C(R9) sug) As 8 varies in R*, the induced Poisson
measures Ug are mutually singular. We thus obtain an uncountable family
of distinct systems of imprimitivity for (c(R*) 83). There are many
more such systems!

So far we've only described the kinematics of interacting particles.

The possible dynamics of interacting particles can also be obtained

--- Page 90 ---
89

from the group theoretic point of view. Of course, at this point, it
becomes more natural to replace the Newtonian space-time group 3 x -T
by the Galilean or Lorentz group and to also consider theories of
interacting events and trajectories. Such analyses are capable of
deriving the standard Schrodinger and Dirac equations for N-interacting
particles. Thus, after a long arduous journey requiring some of the
deepest results of modern mathematics, we arrive at the place where the
physicist usually begins! But this trip is well worth taking, because
in making it, we gain a much deeper understanding of the physicist's
usual starting point. The trip also suggests other possible starting
points.

One is now in a position to reap a fantastic harvest. By studying
the Schrodinger equation with a Coulomb interaction potential, one
can obtain the spectrum of atoms, molecules, positronium, munomium,
etc. One can obtain a theoretical understanding of valence and of
the periodic table. The structure of small molecules can be
directly predicted, and at least qualitative insights can be
obtained for the structure of large molecules. These successes have
been repeated in the study of the structure of nuclei and more
recently in the study of hadrons. With the recent proliferation of
quarks having various "flavors, colors, and tastes", one can
anticipate a similar theory of quark chemistry based upon an even
more fundamental sub-domain. In all these theories, symmetry
winciples and group theory play a fundamental role. The importance
of group theory in analysing these phenomena was first clearly seen

by Weyl B4] and Wigner [90] (see the surveys by Michel and O'Raifeartaigh

--- Page 91 ---
90

in [98]). All that is further needed for a fundamental comprehensive
understanding of the physical world is quantum statistical mechanics

and quantum field theory.

§3.6. Quantum Statistical Mechanics,

The goals of quantum statistical mechanics are identical to those
of classical statistical mechanics: to derive the bulk properties of
matter starting from an underlying atomic model. For example, one might
model a container of gas by first assuming the existence of a microscope
capable of yielding "the locations of the atoms in the gas", i.e., a
microscope which outputs a finite subset of the region enclosed by the
container. If one now assumes. that one is looking at a "composite system
of interacting quantum mechanical" particles, then one is led to the
standard description of such a gas. The main problem with this program
is that the Gibb's state describing a gas in equilibrium turns out not
to be a pure vector state, but, instead, an impure density matrix state.
The problem of justifying on the basis of first principles the use of
the various canonical ensembles is the same for classical and quantum
statistical mechanics (see [10 for a thorough discussion of the teantam
tions of both classical and quantum statistical mechanics). We feel the
"cure" is also the same: to consider all probability measures on our
logics as capable of describing individual systems and to allow the
dynamics to be governed by a stochastic process. In this way the many
successes of quantum statistical mechanics (e.g., its theories of the
specific heats of gases; of black body radiation; of plasmas; of low
temperature phenomena; etc.) can be obtained from first principles without
having to have recourse to (probably sees eeketient) ergodic theorems.

Over the past decade there has been a great deal of activity in the
study of the limiting properties of atomic models as the number of atoms
N goes to infinity, (i.e., in the thermodynamical limit see [104]). In

fact, interest has focused upon the explicit construction of models

--- Page 93 ---
92

containing an infinite number of particles. In these models one can give
very precise mathematical definitions of phenomena such as phase coma
tions. Wilson's pioneering work on the renormalization group appears to
be leading to a satisfactory understanding of many such critical phenomena
(see [94]). In the study of these models one is led away from the
standard assumption that ie = Proj(H). Instead, one typically assumes
that one has a diagram {@, }, where A varies over the bounded subsets of

R° Cor e, or R4, etc.) and where ie is the partial algebra of continuous
A
real-valued observables in A. One also assumes that the diagram {@, 3
A

is isomorphic to the subdiagram of Hermitian elements in a diagram of

C*-algebras {A,}, i.e., that {@, } = {Herm (A ,) }. Instead of working
n

directly with {Herm (A ,)}, one usually works with Herm(A_), where A_ is the

*
direct limit C -algebra, Lim {A One of the usual reasons for passing

a}:
to the direct limit A_is that one can assume that the natural action of
the Euclidean group 83 on R? induces an action on A, (and, as we've seen,
symmetry principles are crucial for obtaining results). But $3 also acts
naturally on the diagram {A 4} if it is thought of as an object in the
category ginj-(C*-algebras) . One could thus create a satisfactory theory
based upon the diagram {A 43. while avoiding having to introduce certain

extra ad hoc assumptions to eliminate consideration of "unphysical" states

on AL (see, for instance, the discussion by B. Simon in [69]).

--- Page 94 ---
93

§3.7. Quantum Field Theory.

The original goal of quantum field theory was to describe such
phenomena as the interaction of electrons with the electro-magnetic
field. From the very beginning, all non-trivial models were plagued
with infinities. This provoked some to attempt to abandon the con-
tinuum and to work with discrete space-times or to make other radical
departures from the traditional formalism. But the collection of
ad hoc tricks to remove the infinities, called renormalization theory,
yielded such accurate predictions that it was clear that there was
at least some "truth" in the traditional formalism. The traditional
formalism assumed the existence of observable fields o(t,x) and n(t,x)

obeying the canonical commutation relations

[o(t,x),e(t,y)] = O = [wlt,x),n(t,y)]
(3.7.22 [o(t,x),a(t,y)] = ihe(x-y) ,

and of a Hamiltonian given (for example) by

(357.2) n= f [n? + (ve)? + my" + do“ Jax .

R°
For systems having finitely many degrees of freedom, von Neumann showed
that the corresponding Heisenberg commutation relations (in Weyl
form) had a unique representation; but von Neumann's result does not
extend to systems having infinitely many degrees of freedom. In fact,
work of Mackey and Glimm shows that there are so many representations
of (3.7.1) that they cannot even be parametrized by countably many

real-valued parameters. Thus, one cannot "Survey" all the possibilities

The traditional favorite was the Fock representation. But, during the

--- Page 95 ---
94

the 1950's it was realized that the Fock representation could almost
never be used to describe Euclidean invariant interacting systems
(e.g., one in which sense could be made of (3.7,2)). Over the past
ten years one has learned how to make (3.7.1) and (3.7.2) precise,
at least in two-dimensional space-time (see [66]). In four-dimensional
space-time there are arguments which suggest that the equal time
commutators in (3.7.1) will not exist in interesting models (even
after being smeared in the space variables). Thus, one will have to
begin by making more basic assumptions, (Note that in our approach
the commutation relations for systems of finitely many degrees of
freedom was not a basic assumption, but, instead, a consequence of
looking for systems of imprimitivity for (n°, £3) .)

In general, a (smeared, scalar) field is defined to be an assign-
ment f - o(f) of a real-valued observable o(f) to every test function
f on space-time from an appropriate space , of such test functions
(e.g., the rapidly decreasing C*-functions). The assignment should be
linear and continuous. One also usually assumes that the field is
relativistically invariant (i.e., one has an.action of the inhomogeneous
Lorentz group L on the partial algebra of real-valued observables such
that o(g(f)) = gp(f)) and local (i.e., if {f, € 2} have space-Like
separated supports, then the family of observables {o(f,)} is compatible
In classical field theory one usually models a field by a continuous
function g(x) on space-time. Associated with such a g(x) one has the

smeared field f - hy f£(x)o(x)dx. Smeared fields can be very singular
4
R
locally. In quantum field theory one usually assumes that ones fieids

--- Page 96 ---
95

satisfy the Wightman axioms. Namely, that there is a complex

separable Hilbert space of states H on which we are given a (projective)
representation of L which satisfies the spectral condition that the
spectral resolution of the energy-momentum vector observable is
supported on the positive light cone. Furthermore, there is a unique
invariant vector Yo € H (the "vacuum"), and a dense invariant domain

D CH such that each o(f) is represented by a Hermitian operator on

D. Major successes of the Wightman axioms include the PCT Theorem,

the Spin-Statistics Theorem, and.the Haag-Ruelle scattering theory.

The Spin-Statistics Theorem provides a fundamental justification. for

a rule that was introduced ad hoc into particle physics and is crucial
for the theoretical explanation of the Mendeleev table and many other
important phenomena, The Haag-Ruelle scattering theory is important
because in most scattering experiments one has direct information

only about the incoming and outgoing states and physicists tend to
prefer to describe the incoming and outgoing states using a particle

as opposed to field language. A major weakness of the Wightman axioms
is that there are still no known non-trivial models in four-dimensional
space-time. Non-trivial models have been constructed in two-and
three-dimensional space-times and they exhibit all the phenomena one
expected of them from perturbation theory arguments. It is not clear
at this point whether more hard analysis will yield the appropriate
four-dimensional models or, instead, one will need a major departure
from the Wightman axioms to obtain the desired models. One alternative
approach is to start with the diagram of local partial algebras of

observables {@,}) where A is a bounded subset of space-time, and make

--- Page 97 ---
96
direct assumptions on its structure. Using such an approach,
Araki [102] was able to derive an analog of the Haag-Ruelle scattering
theory and Haag and Kastler [103] were able to give a theoretical

explanation of super-selection sectors.

§3.8. Final Remarks.

We have presented a coherent approach to quantum mechanics which
yields all its positive results while simultaneously short-circuiting
all its paradoxes. For example, we have no "measurement problem".

The measurement problem is avoided by not introducing the notion of
the "system itself". Our fundamental axioms relate directly to the
structure of the deep logic which itself represents interlocking modes
of perceiving. E-P-R type paradoxes are avoided in a similar fashion.
In particular, even if the probability is one of yielding the value

a upon measurement of the observable A, we say nothing about "its
value" if a measurement is not made. On the other hand, we have no
ontology, not even when the deep logic is Boolean, We thus have an
adequate formulation of how the world appears, but not of what it

actually is.
