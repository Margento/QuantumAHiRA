The im-\npossibility of harmonizing the Maxwellian theory with the pronouncedly\nvisual concepts expressed in the hypothesis of light quanta subsequently\ncompelled research workers to the conclusion that radiation phenomena can\nonly be understood by largely renouncing their immediate visualization. The\nfact, already found by Planck and used by Einstein, Debye, and others, that\nthe element of discontinuity detected in radiation phenomena also plays an\nimportant part in material processes, was expressed systematically in Bohr’s\nbasic postulates of the quantum theory which, together with the Bohr-\nSommerfeld quantum conditions of atomic structure, led to a qualitative\ninterpretation of the chemical and optical properties of atoms. The accept-\nance of these basic postulates of the quantum theory contrasted uncom-\npromisingly with the application of classical mechanics to atomic systems,\nwhich, however, at least in its qualitative affirmations, appeared indispen-\nsable for understanding the properties of atoms. This circumstance was a fresh\nargument in support of the assumption that the natural phenomena in which\nPlanck’s constant plays an important part can be understood only by largely\nforegoing a visual description of them. Classical physics seemed the limiting\ncase of visualization of a fundamentally unvisualizable microphysics, the more\naccurately realizable the more Planck’s constant vanishes relative to the\nparameters of the system.

Firstly it was only wave\nmechanics which made possible the mathematical treatment of complex\natomic systems, secondly analysis of the connection between the two theo-\nries led to what is known as the transformation theory developed by Dirac\nand Jordan. As it is impossible within the limits of the present lecture to give\na detailed discussion of the mathematical structure of this theory, I should\njust like to point out its fundamental physical significance. Through the\nadoption of the physical principles of quantum mechanics into its expanded\nformalism, the transformation theory made it possible in completely general\nterms to calculate for atomic systems the probability for the occurrence of a\nparticular, experimentally ascertainable, phenomenon under given experi-\nmental conditions. The hypothesis conjectured in the studies on the radia-\ntion theory and enunciated in precise terms in Born’s collision theory, name-\nly that the wave function governs the probability for the presence of a cor-\npuscle, appeared to be a special case of a more general pattern of laws and\nto be a natural consequence of the fundamental assumptions of quantum\nmechanics. Schrédinger, and in later studies Jordan, Klein, and Wigner as\nwell, had succeeded in developing as far as permitted by the principles of\nthe quantum theory de Broglie’s original concept of visualizable matter\nwaves occurring in space and time, a concept formulated even before the\ndevelopment of quantum mechanics. But for that the connection between\nSchrédinger’s concepts and de Broglie’s original thesis would certainly have\nseemed a looser one by this statistical interpretation of wave mechanics and\nby the greater emphasis on the fact that Schrédinger’s theory is concerned\nwith waves in multidimensional space.
