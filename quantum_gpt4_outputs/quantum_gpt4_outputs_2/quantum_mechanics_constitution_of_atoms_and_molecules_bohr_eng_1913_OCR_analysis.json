Now in Wood’s experiments\nthe pressure was not very low, and the states corresponding\nto high values for r could therefore not appear ; yet in the\nabsorption spectrum about 50 lines were detected. Tn the\nexperiments in question we consequently observe an absorption\nof radiation which is not accompanied by a complete transition\nbetween two different stationary states. According to the\npresent theory we must assume that this absorption is followed\nby an emission of energy during which the systems pass back\nto the original stationary state. If there are no collisions\nbetween the different systems this energy will be emitted as\na radiation of the same frequency as that absorbed, and there\nwill be no true absorption but only a scattering of the original\nradiation ; a true absorption will not oceur unless the energy\nin question is transformed by coilisions into kinetic energy of\nfree particles. In analogy we may now from the above expe-\nriments conclude that a bound electron—also in cases in which\nthere is no ionization—will have an absorbing (scattering)\ninfluence on a homogeneous radiation, as soon as the fre-\nquency of the radiation is greater than W/h, where W is the\ntotal amount of energy emitted during the binding of the\nelectron. This would be highly in favour of a theory of\nabsorption as the one sketched above, as there can in sucha\ncase be no question of a coincidence of the frequency of the\nradiation and a characteristic frequency of vibration of the\nelectron. It will further be seen that the assumption, that\nthere will be an absorption (scattering) of any radiation\ncorresponding to a transition between two different me-\nchanical states, is in perfect analogy with the assumption\ngenerally used that a free electron will have an absorbing\n(seattering) influence on light of any frequency.
