In this paper, I re-examine Bohr’s interpretation of\nquantum mechanics, and argue that the necessity of the classical can be seen as part of\nhis response to the measurement problem. More generally, I attempt to clarify Bohr’s\nview on the classical/quantum divide, arguing that the relation between the two theories\nis that of mutual dependence. An important element in this clarification consists in\ndistinguishing Bohr’s idea of the wave function as symbolic from both a purely\nepistemic and an ontological interpretation. Together with new evidence concerning\nBohr’s conception of the wave function collapse, this sets his interpretation apart from\nboth standard versions of the Copenhagen interpretation, and from some of the\nreconstructions of his view found in the literature. I conclude with a few remarks on\nhow Bohr’s ideas make much sense also when modern developments in quantum\ngravity and early universe cosmology are taken into account.",

In particular, it may only be possible to address the\nquantum structure of spacetime (in a very small region) when a classical structure of\nspacetime (in a large region containing the small one) is presupposed.** Regarding\nmodern cosmology, a key issue is the supposed transition between quantum fluctuations\nand classical density perturbations during an assumed inflationary phase in the very\nearly universe. This transition is believed to lie at the origin of structure formation in the\nuniverse. However, the idea is faced with what one may call the ‘cosmic measurement\nproblem’; the problem of how to get classical structures from quantum constituents in a\ncosmological context. Also in this case, it may be argued — in consistency with Bohr’s\npoint of view — that any account of the developments in the very early universe will\ndepend on assuming part of the total system to be classical. In particular, such\nclassicality may be needed in order to secure a physically meaningful concept of time,\nwhich is a precondition for addressing issues about the ‘early’ universe. Thus, as argued\nin Rugh and Zinkernagel (2011, 2013), a well-defined cosmic time concept is closely\nrelated to a classically described motion of matter in the universe.",
